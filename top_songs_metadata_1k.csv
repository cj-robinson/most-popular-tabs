For chords in original key transpose this chord sheet +1 (and ""use flats"").
 
Play this song with the regular shapes of the chords given in this song
or use the ones that can be heard on the recording:
 
      E-A-D-G-B-e
G     3-x-0-0-3(3)
Em    0-2-2-0-3(3) (= Em7)
C     x-3-2-0-3(3) (= Cadd9)
[Coda]
Dsus4 x-x-0-2-3-3 or x-x-0-0-3-3 (= a D chord which is neither major nor minor)
G/B   x-2-0-0-0-3  (= G chord with a ""b"" as the root)
D/F#  2-x-0-2-3-x  (= D chord with a ""f#"" as the root)

[Verse 1]
          G        Em
I found a love for me
              C                            D
Darling, just dive right in, and follow my lead
                G          Em
Well, I found a girl beautiful and sweet
        C                                     D
I never knew you were the someone waiting for me
 
[Pre-Chorus]
                                G
Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
            Em                      C                G  D
Not knowing what it was, I will not give you up this ti-ime
             G                           Em
Darling just kiss me slow, your heart is all I own
            C                     D
And in your eyes you're holding mine
 
[Chorus]
      Em   C             G          D              Em
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
C                G     D                Em
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song
          C                G                 D              Em
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
         C                G        D          G
But you heard it, darling you look perfect tonight

[Verse 2]
                G                    Em
Well, I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know
              C                                          D
She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home
           G             Em
I found a love, to carry more than just my secrets
         C                              D
To carry love, to carry children of our own
 
[Pre-Chorus]
                             G                     Em
We are still kids, but we're so in love, fighting against all odds
             C               G  D
I know we'll be alright this ti-ime
             G                              Em
Darling just hold my hand, be my girl, I'll be your man
         C               D
I see my future in your eyes
 
[Chorus]
      Em   C              G         D              Em
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
C                G     D                Em
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song
        C                G                D
When I saw you in that dress, looking so beautiful
  Em       C                  G        D          G
I don't deserve this, darling you look perfect tonight

C                G     D                Em
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song
        C              G               D             Em
I have faith in what I see, now I know I have met an angel
    C          G         D
In person, and she looks perfect
 
[Outro]
  G/B     C           Dsus4    D          G
I don't deserve this, you look perfect tonight

[Verse 1]
  C                 Am
I heard there was a secret chord
     C                   Am
That David played and it pleased the Lord
    F                G               C        G
But you don't really care for music, do you?
        C                  F           G
Well it goes like this the fourth, the fifth
    Am                 F
The minor fall and the major lift
    G            E7             Am
The baffled king composing hallelujah
 
[Chorus]
     F           Am          F           C    G   C      Am C Am
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelu-u-u-u-jah ....
 
[Verse 2]
           C                        Am
Well, your faith was strong but you needed proof
    C               Am
You saw her bathing on the roof
    F              G             C            G
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you
    C               F       G
She tied you to her kitchen chair
    Am                        F
She broke your throne and she cut your hair
    G                  E7            Am
And from your lips she drew the hallelujah
 
[Chorus]
     F           Am          F           C    G   C      Am C Am

[Verse 3]
C               Am
Baby, I've been here before
     C                       Am
I've seen this room and I've walked this floor
  F             G             C          G
I used to live alone before I knew you
     C                     F      G
I've seen your flag on the marble arch
    Am               F
But love is not a victory march
       G               E7          Am
It's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah
 
[Chorus]
     F           Am          F           C    G   C      Am C Am
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelu-u-u-u-jah ....
 
[Verse 4]
            C                   Am
Well, there was a time when you let me know
       C            Am
What's really going on below
    F             G               C        G
But now you never show that to me do you
      C             F        G
But remember when I moved in you
        Am            F
And the holy dove was moving too
    G               E7            Am
And every breath we drew was hallelujah
 
[Chorus]
     F           Am          F           C    G   C      Am C Am

[Verse 5]
      C               Am
Well, maybe there's a God above
    C             Am
But all I've ever learned from love
    F                G           C          G
Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew you
     C                  F       G
It's not a cry that you hear at night
     Am                 F
It's not somebody who's seen the light
       G               E7          Am
It's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah
 
[Outro]
     F           Am          F           C    G   C
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelu-u-u-u ....
     F           Am          F           C    G   C
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelu-u-u-u ....
     F           Am          F           C    G   C
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelu-u-u-u-jah ....
Am        F   G     C

Only know you've been high when you're feeling low

Only hate the road when you're missin' home

[Chorus] (One Strum)
                         F                           C
'Cause you only need the light when it's burning low
              G                       Am
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
               F                           C       G
Only know you love her when you let her go
N.C.
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
 
Only hate the road when you're missin' home
 
Only know you love her when you let her go
 
And you let her go

Drawing me in, and you kicking me out

Got my head spinning, no kidding, I can't pin you down

You're my downfall, you're my muse

      G
Well, you done done me in; you bet I felt it
  D
I tried to be chill but you're so hot that I melted
  Em
I fell right through the cracks

Now I'm tryin' to get back
 
           G
Before the cool done run out, I'll be givin' it my bestest
    D
and nothin's gonna stop me but divine intervention

I reckon it's again my turn

To win some or learn some

But I won't hesitate

  Well, open up your mind and see like me
                                   Em
Open up your plans and damn you're free

Look into your heart and you'll find love, love, love, love

[Verse 3]
                   G
I've been spending way too long checking my tongue in the mirror
    D
And bending over backwards just to try to see it clearer
    Em
But my breath fogged up the glass
         C
And so I drew a new face and I laughed
  G
I guess what I'll be saying is there ain't no better reason
   D
To rid yourself of vanities and just go with the seasons
   Em
It's what we aim to do
    C
Our name is our virtue
 
[Chorus]
    G           D Dsus4
But I won't hesitate

No more, no more

It cannot wait; I'm yours

Well, open up your mind and see like me

Open up your plans and damn you're free

Look into your heart and you'll find that the sky is yours
   G
So please don't, please don't, please don't
           D        Dsus4
There's no need to complicate
           Em
'Cause our time is short

C  G         Am        E7             F
So Sally can wait, she knows it's too late
         G          C   Am G
as she's walking on by
   C    G       Am
My soul slides away
               F
But don't look back in anger
           Fm6
Don't look back in anger
            C   G   Am   E7   F   Fm6              C
I heard you say                     At least not today

[Verse 1]
 
            C              G/B          Am
For all the times that you rain on my parade
            Dm               C        G/B
And all the clubs you get in using my name
              C                  G/B         Am
You think you broke my heart, oh girl for goodness sake
              Dm            C           G/B
You think I'm crying, on my own, well I ain't
                   C           G/B                  Am
And I didn't wanna write a song cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
   Dm        C                G/B
I don't but, you still hit my phone up
                 C        G/B              Am
And baby I'll be movin' on and I think you should be somethin'
              Dm         C                G/B
I don't wanna hold back, maybe you should know that
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
 
              Am           F              C
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
            Am      F                C
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
                 Am          F               C                G
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
          Am  F            G
And now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own
 
 
[Chorus]
 
             C        G       Am        F
Cause if you like the way you look that much
        C                 F        C
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
           C          G         Am      F
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
C                 F        C
You should go and love yourself
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
             C                G/B      Am
But when you told me that you hated my friends
         Dm               C           G/B
The only problem was with you and not them
          C             G/B            Am
And every time you told me my opinion was wrong
             Dm             C            G/B
And tried to make me forget where I came from
                   C           G/B                  Am
And I didn't wanna write a song cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
   Dm        C                G/B
I don't but, you still hit my phone up
                 C        G/B              Am
And baby I'll be movin' on and I think you should be somethin'
              Dm         C                G/B
I don't wanna hold back, maybe you should know that
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
 
              Am           F              C

            Am      F                C
And I never like to admit that I was wrong

You should go and love yourself

[Verse 3]
 
            C              G/B          Am
For all the times that you made me feel small
          Dm               C          G/B
I fell in love, now I feel nothin' at all
        C                G/B          Am
I never felt so low when I was vulnerable
        Dm              C             G/B
Was I a fool to let you break down my walls?
 
 
[Chorus]
 
             C        G       Am        F
Cause if you like the way you look that much
        C                 F        C
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
           C          G         Am      F
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
C                 F        C
You should go and love yourself
             C        G       Am        F
Cause if you like the way you look that much

Oh baby you should go and love yourself
           C          G         Am      F

You should go and love yourself

[Verse 1]
C                         D/F#
So, so you think you can tell,
             Am/E                   G
Heaven from Hell, blue skies from pain.
                     D/F#                      C                    Am
Can you tell a green field from a cold steel rail, a smile from a veil,
                      G
Do you think you can tell?
 
[Verse 2]
                      C                   D/F#
Did they get you to trade your heroes for ghosts,
                Am/E                  G                             D/F#
Hot ashes for trees, hot air for a cool breeze, cold comfort for change,

And did you exchange a walk on part in the war for a lead role in a cage?

[Verse 3]
C                               D/F#
How I wish, how I wish you were here.
           Am/E                                    G
We're just two lost souls swimming in a fish bowl, year after year,
D/F#                               C
 Running over the same old ground. What have we found?
             Am                         G
The same old fears. Wish you were here!

Capo 2
 
[Intro]
Am   E7   G   D   F   C   Dm   E7   x2
 
[Verse]
Am                         E7
  On a dark desert highway, cool wind in my hair
G                      D
  Warm smell of colitas rising up through the air
F                          C
  Up ahead in the distance, I saw a shimmering light
Dm
   My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
E7
  I had to stop for the night
 
Am                               E7
  There she stood in the doorway; I heard the mission bell
G
  And I was thinking to myself
              D
This could be heaven or this could be hell
F                          C
  Then she lit up a candle, and she showed me the way
Dm
   There were voices down the corridor,
E7
  I thought I heard them say...
 
[Chorus]
F                          C
  Welcome to the Hotel California.
       E7                                         Am
Such a lovely place (such a lovely place), such a lovely face
F                               C
Plenty of room at the Hotel California
    Dm                                       E7
Any time of year (any time of year), you can find it here
 
[Verse]
Am                            E7
 Her mind is Tiffany-twisted, she got the Mercedes bends
G                                    D
 She got a lot of pretty pretty boys   she calls friends
F                                   C
  How they danced in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat
Dm                       E7
  Some dance to remember, some dance to forget
 
Am                           E7
  So I called up the captain; Please bring me my wine (he said)
G                                     D
 We haven't had that spirit here since 1969
F                                         C
  and still those voices are calling from far away
Dm
   Wake you up in the middle of the night
E7
  Just to hear them say...
 
[Chorus]
F                         C
 Welcome to the Hotel California.
       E7                                         Am
Such a lovely place (such a lovely place), such a lovely face
        F                             C
They're livin' it up at the Hotel California
       Dm                                               E7
What a nice surprise (what a nice surprise), bring your alibis
 
[Verse]
Am                        E7
   Mirrors on the ceiling; the pink champagne on ice (and she said)
G                                D
  We are all just prisoners here, of our own device
F                              C
  and in the master's chambers, they gathered for the feast
Dm
 They stab it with their steely knives but they
E7
just can't kill the beast
 
Am                             E7
   Last thing I remember, I was running for the door
G                                       D
  I had to find the passage back to the place I was before
F                                   C
  ""Relax"" said the night man; we are programmed to receive
Dm
  You can check out any time you like

An incredibly simple but fantastic song to play on an acoustic guitar!
There seems to be a lot of confusion about the key of the song.
It does state below that a capo is required, but for those that don't have a capo,
I have taken the liberty of putting a set of chords on which do not require a capo
and will allow you to play along with the CD.
 
EDIT (08/05/2020) - it's been a long time since I originally submitted this and I must say it will NOT let
you play along to the song.  The tuning of the song is very unique.  I think it's tuned in 4ths
(which basically means the high b and e strings become c and f.  These strings are then played as open
throughout).  But even then it still doesn't quite sound right.
 
Oh well, I'm happy with my version as an acoustic...

We were both young when I first saw you
  F
I close my eyes and the flashback starts
             Am                    F
I'm standing there on a balcony in summer air
C
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
F
See you make your way through the crowd
            Am
And say, ""Hello""
           G
Little did I know
 
[Pre-Chorus]
     F                        G
That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
       Am                          C
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
          F
And I was crying on the staircase
G                        Am  F      G
Begging you please don't go,   and I said

Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone

I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
Am
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess

It's a love story, baby, just say ""yes""
 
[Verse 2]
   C
So I sneak out to the garden to see you
F
We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew
              Am
So close your eyes
                       G
Escape this town for a little while

'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
       Am                        C
And my daddy said stay away from Juliet
             F
But you were everything to me

This love is difficult, but it's real

Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess

I got tired of waiting,   wondering if you were ever coming around
                   Am     F
My faith in you was fading
       C                           G
When I met you on the outskirts of town and I said

Romeo, save me I've been feeling so alone
G
I keep waiting for you but you never come
   Am
Is this in my head, I don't know what to think

He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said

Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone

I love you, and that's all I really know

For some reason I can't explain
  G                      Em
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
         C      D
Never an honest word

But that was when I ruled the world

G                                 Dm                    Cmaj7
When I was younger I saw my daddy cry and curse at the wind
   G                                                Dm          Cmaj7
He broke his own heart and I watched as he tried to re-assemble it
    G                                      Dm         Cmaj7
And my mama swore that she would never let herself forget
    G                                                  Dm

if it does not exist, but darling

You are the only exception

G                                 Dm                   Cmaj7
Maybe I know somewhere deep in my soul that love never lasts
    G                                         Dm                     Cmaj7
And we've got to find other ways to make it alone or keep a straight face
    G                                        Dm        Cmaj7
And I've always lived like this, keeping a comfortable distance
    G                                              Dm              Cmaj7
And up until now I had sworn to myself that I'm content with loneliness
 
Because none of it was ever worth the risk
 
[Chorus]
      G
Well, you are the only exception
Dm          Cmaj7

Let go of what's in front of me here
              Am
I know you're leaving in the morning when you wake up
         G                                  D         C
Leave me with some kind of proof it's not a dream, whoa

Hey there Delilah, what’s it like in New York City? 
      D                               F#m
I’m a thousand miles away, but girl tonight you look so pretty, 
        Bm  G                 A                  Bm
Yes you do, Time Square can’t shine as bright as you,

I swear it’s true.
D                            F#m
Hey there Delilah, don’t you worry about the distance, 
          D                                  F#m
I’m right there if you get lonely, give this song another listen, 
           Bm    G            A                Bm
Close your eyes, listen to my voice it’s my disguise,

I’m by your side.

           D                                    F#m
But just believe me girl some day, I'll pay the bills with this guitar, 
              Bm    G              A               Bm
We'll have it good, we'll have the life we knew we would,

My word is good.
D                           F#m
Hey there Delilah, I’ve got so much left to say, 
         D                                 F#m
If every simple song I wrote to you, would take your breath away,
             Bm   G            A                  Bm
I’d write it all, even more in love with me you’d fall, 
             A
We’d have it all.

[Bridge]
  G                                    A
A thousand miles seems pretty far, but they’ve got planes and trains and cars, 
    D                             Bm
I’d walk to you if I had no other way 
    G                                     A
Our friends would all make fun of us, and we'll just laugh along because, 
   D                                     Bm
We know that none of them have felt this way, 
  G                             A
Delilah I can promise you, that by the time that we get through, 
    Bm                                               A
The world will never ever be the same, and you’re to blame.
 
[Verse 3]
D                        F#m
Hey there Delilah you be good, and don’t you miss me, 
         D                                         F#m
Two more years and you’ll be done with school, and I'll be making history, 
       Bm  G                A              Bm
Like I do, you’ll know it's all because of you, 
G             A            Bm
We can do whatever we want to, 
G           A               Bm                  A
Hey there Delilah here's to you, this one’s for you.
 
[Final Chorus]
D                      Bm  D                      Bm    A
Oh it’s what you do to me, Oh it’s what you do to me, 
D                      Bm  D                      Bm
Oh it’s what you do to me, Oh it’s what you do to me,

G             Em             D                         C         G
 Almost Heaven; West Virginia, Blue Ridge Mountains, Shenandoah River.
G                   Em                     D
 Life is old there, older than the trees, younger than the mountains,
  C              G
Growin' like a breeze.
 
[Chorus]
 
         G              D            Em         C
Country Roads, take me home, to the place, I belong,
         G               D             C             G

 All my memories gather 'round her, miner's lady, stranger to blue water.
G                 Em                  D
 Dark and dusty, painted on the sky, misty taste of moonshine,
  C            G
Teardrop in my eye.

Em             D            G
   I hear her voice in the morning hour she calls me,
    C        G             D
The radio reminds me of my home far away.
    Em                F            C
And driving down the road I get a feeling
       G                     D                 D7
That I should have been home yesterday, yesterday.

Country Roads, take me home, to the place, I belong,

Saying I love you is

[Chorus]
G              D/F#     Em        Bm      C

C                   G/B     Am7             D7                G
More than words to show you feel that your love for me is real
G              D/F#     Em7        Bm     C
What would you say if I took those words away?
C                     G/B      Am7
Then you couldn't make things new
        D7            G
Just by saying I love you

high e string fretted with your pinky. This makes the chords G major, Am7, Fadd9, and C major. I also
suggest playing a Hendrix Fadd9, so wrap your thumb and play 1st fret low E string:
 
Am7    x-0-2-2-1-3
Fadd9  1-x-3-2-1-3
C      x-3-2-0-1-3
G      3-x-0-0-0-3
 
The strum pattern for Intro/Verse/Transition is picked for the downs and strummed for the ups.
I suggest picking the A and D strings, and then up strum.

a guitar that is tuned down one full step (D-G-C-F-A-d), that's
why the song sounds in the key of F. Transposed +2 to G (the way
McCartney played it in the studio and plays it live until today)
the song is much easier to play.

Ah, ah ah ah

Ah ah ah ah, ah ah ah
 
 
[Verse 1]
 
  D
Oh her eyes, her eyes, make the stars look like they're not shining
Bm7
 Her hair, her hair, falls perfectly without her trying
G                                        D
 She's so beautiful, and I tell her every day
 
     D
Yeah, I know, I know when I compliment her she won't believe me
Bm7
 And it's so, it's so sad to think that she don't see what I see
G                                             D
 But every time she asks me do I look okay, I say

When I see your face, there's not a thing that I would change

Cause girl you're amazing, just the way you are, (yeah)

D
 Her lips, her lips, I could kiss them all day if she'd let me

 Her laugh, her laugh, she hates but I think it's so sexy
G                                         D
 She's so beautiful, and I tell her every day
 
        D
Oh, you know, you know, you know I'd never ask you to change
   Bm7
If perfect is what you're searching for, then just stay the same
G                                                            D

Dreaming about the things that we could be
    Am               C
But baby, I've been, I've been praying hard,

           Am
I see this life like a swinging vine
C
Swing my heart across the line
    G
And in my face is flashing signs
F
Seek it out and ye shall find
Am
Old, but I'm not that old
C
Young, but I'm not that bold
G
I don't think the world is sold
F
On just doing what we're told
 
[Pre-Chorus]
Am C                G
I feel something so right

Doing the wrong thing
Am C                G
I feel something so wrong
          F
Doing the right thing

I couldn't lie, couldn't lie, couldn't lie

Everything that kills me makes me feel alive

Down this river, every turn

Make that money, watch it burn

Oh, take that money, watch it burn
 
Sink in the river the lessons I learned
N.C.
Take that money, watch it burn
 
Sink in the river the lessons I learned

Take that money, watch it burn
 
Sink in the river the lessons I learned

[Verse 1]
D                                                   A
You're on the phone with your girlfriend, she's upset
                                         Em
She's going off about something that you said
                                       G
'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do
D                                        A
I'm in the room, it's a typical Tuesday night
                                                Em
I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like
                                      G
And she'll never know your story like I do
 
[Pre-Chorus]
    Em                      G
But she wears short skirts, I wear T-shirts
D                       A
She's cheer captain and I'm on the bleachers
Em                              G
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
                A
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time

If you could see that I'm the one who understands you

D                                               A
Walkin' the streets with you and your worn out jeans
                                              Em
I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be
                                        G
Laughing on a park bench, thinking to myself

    D                                                  A

                                                   Em
I haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down
 
You say you're fine, I know you better than that

Hey, whatcha doing with a girl like that
 
[Pre-Chorus]
Em                    G
She wears high heels, I wear sneakers

Standing by and waiting at your back door

I'm the one who makes you laugh

When you know you're about to cry

I know your favorite songs

[Verse 1]
      C
Well, you done done me in, you bet I felt it.
  G
I tried to be chill, but you're so hot that I melted.
  Am
I fell right through the cracks.
        F
Now I'm trying to get back.
 
           C
Before the cool done run out, I'll be giving it my bestest,
    G
And nothing's gonna stop me but divine intervention.
  Am
I reckon it's again my turn
   F
To win some or learn some.
 
[Chorus]
    C           G                Am
But I won't hesitate no more, no more.
          F           C
It cannot wait, I'm yours.

  Well, open up your mind and see like me.

Open up your plans and, damn, you're free.
                                     F
Look into your heart and you'll find love, love, love, love.
 
C                                                   G
Listen to the music of the moment; people dance and sing.
                       Am
We're just one big family.
                                      F
And it's our god forsaken right to be loved,

Loved, loved, loved, loved.

                   C
I've been spending way too long checking my tongue in the mirror
    G
And bending over backwards just to try to see it clearer.
    Am
But my breath fogged up the glass,
         F
And so I drew a new face and I laughed.
 
  C
I guess what I'll be saying is there ain't no better reason
   G
To rid yourself of vanities and just go with the seasons.
Am
It's what we aim to do.
    F
Our name is our virtue.
 
[Chorus]
    C           G                Am

  Well, open up your mind and see like me.
                                     Am
Open up your plans and, damn, you're free.
                                         F
Look into your heart and you'll find that the sky is yours.
   C
So please don't, please don't, please don't...
           G
There's no need to complicate.
           Am
'Cause our time is short.

That we might be exactly like we were before we realized

When we were young
 
     Am      C/G         F               C/E
It's hard to admit that, everything just takes me back
        Dm
To when you were there
        G              E7/G#
To when you were there
      Am               C/G         F               C/E
And a part of me keeps holding on, just in case it hasn't gone
        Dm
I guess I still care
   G
Do you still care?

My God this reminds me
                Em     G
Of when we were young

Oh, I'm so mad I'm getting old, it makes me reckless

[Verse 1]
C5               G5
There's a fire starting in my heart,
Bb5                                G5                 Bb5
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark
C5              G5
Finally, I can see you crystal clear.
Bb5                           G5                 Bb5
Go ahead and sell me out and I'll lay your ship bare.
 
C5                     G5
See how I leave, with every piece of you
Bb5                       G5                  Bb5
Don't underestimate the things that I will do.
C5                G5
There's a fire starting in my heart,
Bb5                                G5                   Bb5
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark
 
[Pre-Chorus 1]
Ab               Bb                      Gm
    The scars of your love, remind me of us.
               Ab                           Ab
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all

Baby, I have no story to be told,
Bb5                                G5                  Bb5
But I've heard one on you and I'm gonna make your head burn.
C5                   G5
Think of me in the depths of your despair.
Bb5                          G5                  Bb5
Making a home down there, as mine sure won't be shared.

You had my heart inside of your hand

N.C.
Throw your soul through every open door (Whoa)
N.C.
Count your blessings to find what look for (Whoa-uh)

Turn my sorrow into treasured gold (Whoa)

You pay me back in kind and reap just what you sow.

[Chords]
G: 3x0033      A7sus4: x02033    G/F#: 2x0033     Cadd9: x32033
C*: x32013
G*: 320003     D/F#: 20023x      Dadd4: x54035
NB for beginners, ignore the variations and just play normal C and G chords throughout, it's easier.
I put them in because it does sound better to play them, but it's not completely necessary.
 
[Intro]
G   G   G/F# Em  Cadd9  G
 
[Verse 1]
G                                 G/F#      Em
White lips, pale face, breathing in snowflakes
         Cadd9        G        A7sus4
Burnt lungs, sour taste
G                                      G/F#   Em
Light’s gone, day’s end, struggling to pay rent
          Cadd9       G
Long nights, strange men
 
[Pre-Chorus]
Am7                              C*                   G*
And they say she’s in the Class A Team, stuck in her daydream

Been this way since 18, but lately her face seems, slowly sinking, wasting
               G*                            D/F#
Crumbling like pastries, and they scream the worst things in life come free to us
 
[Chorus 1]
          Em           Cadd9       G
Cos she's just under the upperhand, and go mad for a couple of grams
Em                    Cadd9    G
And she don’t want to go outside tonight
         Em                    Cadd9      G
And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland, or sells love to another man
Em         Cadd9   G       D/F#      Em    Cadd9  G
It’s too cold outside for angels to fly,
              Em   Cadd9  G    G/F#
for angels to fly
 
[Verse 2]
G                                          G/F#       Em
Ripped gloves, raincoat, tried to swim and stay afloat
      Cadd9          G         A7sus4
Dry house, wet clothes
G                                     G/F#      Em
Loose change, bank notes, weary-eyed, dry throat
       Cadd9    G
Call girl, no phone
 
[Pre-Chorus]
Am7                              C*                   G*

It’s too cold outside for angels to fly
 
[Bridge]
Am7           C*              Em
An angel will die, covered in white
       G/F#    G
Closed eye and hoping for a better life
Am7                       C*  slide Dadd4            Em   C*   G*  D/F#
This time, we’ll fade out tonight, straight down the line
                    Em   C*  G*  D/F#
Straight down the line

Tearing love apart

You're gonna catch a cold

[Verse 1]
G
  Twenty-five years and my life is still
Am
Trying to get up that great big hill
   C               G
Of hope for a destination
  G
I realized quickly when I knew I should
         Am
That the world was made up of this brotherhood
   C                      G
Of man, for whatever that means
 
[Pre-Chorus]
         G
And so I cry sometimes when I'm lying in bed
        Am
Just to get it all out, what's in my head
      C                         G
and I - I am feeling a little peculiar
         G
And so I wake in the morning and I step outside
      Am
and I take a deep breath and I get real high and
  C                                             G
I scream from the top of my lungs ""What's going on?""
 
[Chorus]
            G           Am
And I said ""Heyeyeyeyey Heyeyey""

I said ""Hey, what's going on?""
            G           Am

I try all the time, in this institution

                    C
I pray every single day
          G
For a revolution
 
[Pre-Chorus]
         G
And so I cry sometimes when I'm lying in bed
        Am
Just to get it all out, what's in my head
      C                         G
and I - I am feeling a little peculiar
         G
And so I wake in the morning and I step outside
      Am
and I take a deep breath and I get real high and
  C                                             G
I scream from the top of my lungs ""What's going on?""
 
[Chorus]
            G           Am
And I said ""Heyeyeyeyey Heyeyey""
        C                 G
I said ""Hey, what's going on?""
            G           Am
And I said ""Heyeyeyeyey Heyeyey""
        C                 G
I said ""Hey, what's going on?""
 
            G           Am
And I said ""Heyeyeyeyey Heyeyey""
        C                 G
I said ""Hey, what's going on?""
            G           Am
And I said ""Heyeyeyeyey HeyeYEYEYE""
        C                 G
I said ""Hey, what's going on?""
 
[Interlude]
G      Am  C   G
 Ooh, Ooh Ooh
 
[Outro]
G
  Twenty-five years and my life is still
Am                                      C
Trying to get up that great big hill of hope
            G
For a destination

The C minor chord which is played in verse 4 may be a mistake but it is on the recording.

Singin' this will be the day that I die, this will be the day that I die
 
 
[Verse 3]
 
         G                   Am
Now for ten years we've been on our own
      C                   Am          Em                     D         Dsus4 D Dsus2 D
and moss grows fat on a rolling stone but that's not how it used to be
          G     D/F#            Em
When the jester sang for the king and queen
     Am7                C                   Em             A7          D
in a coat he borrowed from James Dean in a voice that came from you and me
         Em*                 D*               Em*                 D*
Oh, and while the king was looking down, the jester stole his thorny crown
     C        G/B   A7       C                D7
The courtroom was adjourned, no verdict was returned
          G         D/F#  Em             Am           C
And while Lennin read a book on Marx, the quartet practiced in the park
    G       D/F#   Em               C       D7    G  C  G        D
And we sang dirges in the dark the day the music died,   we were singin'
 
 
[Chorus]
 
G    C        G        D
Bye, bye Miss American Pie
         G            C             G         D
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
         G        C                  G           D
And them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
        Em*                         A7*  Em*                         D7
Singin' this will be the day that I die, this will be the day that I die
 
 
[Verse 4]
 
G                   Am
Helter skelter in a summer swelter
C                      Am                 Em                     D
the birds flew off with a fallout shelter, eight miles high and fallin' fast
      G   D/F#  Em
It landed foul on the grass
      Am7                C            Em                             A7     D
the players tried for a forward pass, with the jester on the sidelines in a cast
         Em*               D*                  Em*                 D*
Now the half-time air was sweet perfume, while sergeants played a marching tune
C          G/B      A7      C                  D7
We all got up to dance, but we never got the chance
         G        D/F#     Em             Am                  Cm        C
'Cuz the players tried to take the field, the marching band refused to yield
G         D/F#      Em               C       D7    G  C  G           D
Do you recall what was revealed the day the music died,   we started singin'
 
 
[Chorus]
 
G    C        G        D
Bye, bye Miss American Pie
         G            C             G         D
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
         G        C                  G           D
And them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
        Em*                         A7*  Em*                         D7
Singin' this will be the day that I die, this will be the day that I die
 
 
[Verse 5]
 
     G                Am
And there we were all in one place
  C          Am                  Em               D          Dsus4 D Dsus2 D
a generation lost in space, with no time left to start again
            G      D/F#    Em             Am7                 C
So come on Jack be nimble, Jack be quick, Jack Flash sat on a candlestick
      Em           A7             D
'cause fire is the devil's only friend
     Em*              D*               Em*                    D*
And as I watched him on the stage, my hands were clenched in fists of rage
   C      G/B    A7         C                  D7
No angel born in Hell could break that Satan's spell
           G            D/F#      Em             Am              C
And as the flames climbed high into the night to light the sacrificial rite
      G     D/F#     Em                C       D7    G  C  G       D
I saw Satan laughing with delight the day the music died,   he was singin'
 
 
[Chorus]
 
G    C        G        D
Bye, bye Miss American Pie
         G            C             G         D
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
         G        C                  G           D

Singin' this will be the day that I die, this will be the day that I die
 
 
[Verse 6]
 
G       D/F#     Em
I met a girl who sang the blues
      Am                 C               Em                  D
And I asked her for some happy news, but she just smiled and turned away
G         D/F#     Em
I went down to the sacred store
       Am              C                        Em                  C
Where I'd heard the music years before, but the man there said the music
          D
wouldn't play
    Em*                Am*                    Em*                  Am*
And in the streets the children screamed, the lovers cried and the poets dreamed
    C     G/B      Am          C                     D
But not a word was spoken, the church bells all were broken
        G         D/F#  Em           C                      D
And the three men I admire most, the Father, Son, and the Holy Ghost
G               D/F#       Em                C       D     G
They caught the last train for the coast the day the music died,
N.C.
And they were singin'
 
 
[Chorus]
 
G    C        G        D
Bye, bye Miss American Pie

[Verse 1]
G                    D/F#
Step one you say we need to talk
    Em7              D/F#             G
He walks you say sit down it’s just a talk
             D/F#           Em7
He smiles politely back at you
             D/F#             G
You stare politely right on through
               D/F#          Em7
Some sort of window to your right
             D/F#             G
As he goes left and you stay right
              D/F#             Em7
Between the lines of fear and blame
                  D/F#
And you begin to wonder why you came
 
[Chorus]
C               D                Em
Where did I go wrong, I lost a friend
            G             D/F#
Somewhere along in the bitterness
    C                   D                Em
And I would have stayed up with you all night

[Instrumental]
G   D/F#   Em7   D/F#
 
[Verse 2]
G                 D/F#
Let him know that you know best
       Em7          D/F#
Cause after all you do know best
G                  D/F#
  Try to slip past his defense
Em7              D/F#
Without granting innocence
G             D/F#             Em7
   Lay down a list of what is wrong
             D/F#
The things you’ve told him all along
G              D/F#
Pray to God he hears you
      Em7            D/F#
And I pray to God he hears you

    G            D/F#
As he begins to raise his voice
    Em7             D/F#                 G
You lower yours and grant him one last choice
                 D/F#
Drive until you lose the road
    Em7                        D/F#
Or break with the ones you’ve followed
G             D/F#
   He will do one of two things
Em7              D/F#
He will admit to everything
G                      D/F#
Or he’ll say he’s just not the same
     Em7            D/F#
And you’ll begin to wonder why you came

[Verse 1]
     G                         D/F#
Going back to the corner where I first saw you,
     Am                               C
Gonna camp in my sleeping bag, no I'm not gonna move,
      G                       D/F#
Got some words on cardboard got your picture in my hand,
     Am                               C
Saying if you see this girl can you tell her where I am,
           G                       D/F#
Some try to hand me money they don't understand,
            Am                               C
I'm not... broke I'm just a broken hearted man,
            G                       D/F#
I know it makes no sense, but what else can I do,
     Am                               C
How can I move on when I'm still in love with you...
 
[Pre-Chorus]
           G                                 D
'Cause if one day you wake up and find that you're missing me,
           Am                                   C
And your heart starts to wonder where on this earth I could be,
         G                                 D
Thinking maybe you'd come back here to the place that we'd meet,
           Am                             C
And you'd see me waiting for you on the corner of the street.
 
[Chorus]
         G       D
So I'm not moving...
        Am      C
I'm not moving.

[Verse 2]
G                        D/F#
  Policeman says, son you can't stay here,
                 Am                      C
I said there's someone I'm waiting for if it's a day, a month, a year,
G                       D/F#
Gotta stand my ground even if it rains or snows,
    Am                               C
If she changes her mind this is the first place she will go.
 
[Pre-Chorus]

Thinking maybe you'd come back here to the place that we'd meet,

[Chorus]

So I'm not moving...
        Am      C
I'm not moving.
        G      D
I'm not moving...
        Am      C
I'm not moving.
 
[Interlude]
Em              Em7      Cadd9
   People talk about the guy
       Cmaj7       D6    D
Who's waiting on a girl...
  Am   Asus2
Oohoohwoo
Em              Em7           Cadd9
   There are no holes in his shoes
          Cmaj7       D6    D
But a big hole in his world...
 Am   Asus2
Hmmmm
 
[Bridge]
Cmaj7                        D
Maybe I'll get famous as the man who can't be moved,
     Am                                  D
And maybe you won't mean to but you'll see me on the news,
                Cmaj7                   D
And you'll come running to the corner...
                              Am
'Cause you'll know it's just for you
 
I'm the man who can't be moved
          C
I'm the man who can't be moved...
 
[Pre-Chorus]
           G                                 D
'Cause if one day you wake up and find that you're missing me,

And if I may just take your breath away
Am
I don't mind if there's not much to say
Em
  The silence guides our minds
    G
to move to a place so far away
C
 The goosebumps start to raise

G              Em             D                       C          G
  Almost Heaven, West Virginia, Blue Ridge Mountains, Shenandoah River.
G                    Em                    D                           C
  Life is old there, older than the trees, younger than the mountains, growin' 
         G
like a breeze.
 
[Chorus]
        G              D            Em        C
Country Roads, take me home, to the place I belong

 All my memories  gather 'round her, miner's lady, stranger to blue water.

  Dark and dusty, painted on the sky, misty taste of moonshine, teardrop in my eye.

[Bridge]
Em          D/F#          G
 I hear her voice, in the mornin' hour she calls me.
    C       G              D
The radio reminds me of my home far away.
    Em               F            C              G
And drivin' down the road I get a feelin' that I should have been home

yesterday, yesterday.

[Verse 1]
 
D
She's got a smile that it seems to me
  C
Reminds me of childhood memories
       G
Where everything
                                D
Was as fresh as a bright blue sky
D
Now and then when I see her face
    C
She takes me away to that special place
         G
And if I stared too long
                              D
I'd probably break down and cry

D
She's got eyes of the bluest skies
   C
As if they thought of rain
    G
I'd hate to look into those eyes
    D
And see an ounce of pain
    D
Her hair reminds me of a warm safe place
      C
Where as a child I'd hide
    G
And pray for the thunder and rain
     D
To quietly pass me by

C/G
Love of mine
        Am/E
someday you will die,
            F
but I'll be close behind;
             C            G
I'll follow you into the dark.
   C/G
No blinding light
              Am/E
or tunnels to gates of white,
               F
just our hands clasped so tight
         C                  G
waiting for the hint of a spark. 
 
[Chorus]
     Am               C              F             C    G/B
If heaven and hell decide that they both are satisfied,
  Am           C              G
illuminate the ""no""s on their vacancy signs.
     Am              C                 E      Am     Am/G
If there's no one beside you when your soul embarks

[Verse]
   C/G
In Catholic school,
              Am/E
as vicious as Roman rule,
          F
I got my knuckles bruised 
     C        G
by a lady in black.
      C/G
And I held my tongue 
       Am/E
as she told me ""Son, 
            F
fear is the heart of love"".
     C          G
So I never went back.

You and me

have seen everything to see

from Bangkok to Calgary, 
        C             G
and the soles of your shoes
     C/G
are all worn down.
             Am/E
The time for sleep is now
                    F
but it's nothing to cry about  
             C               G
'cause we'll hold each other soon
       Am          F
in the blackest of rooms.
 
[Chorus]
     Am               C              F             C    G/B
If heaven and hell decide that they both are satisfied,

illuminate the ""no""s on their vacancy signs.

I used to live alone before I knew ya.

And the holy dove was moving too,

And every breath we drew was hallelujah,

[Verse 5]
G                Em
Maybe there's a God above,
     G                   Em
But all I ever learned from love,
    C                          D      G       D
Was how to shoot at somebody who outdrew ya.
         G                   C       D
And it's not a cry that you hear at night,
      Em                 C
It's not somebody who's seen the light,
       D               B7          Em
It's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah,
     C           Em          C           G   D
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelu-jah
     C           Em          C           G   D
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelu-jah

Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelu ...

D            Gmaj7  A/C#                 F#m
I sat on the roof     and kicked off the moss
        Bm          Bm/A              Bm/G#           Gmaj7

D                    A        F#                   Bm
But the sun's been quite kind, while I wrote this song
D                    Em7     G                A
It's for people like you that keep it turned on
 
D               Gmaj7    A/C#                F#m
So excuse me forgetting,   but these things I do

You see I've forgotten if they're green or they're blue
D                  A                 F#     Bm
Anyway, the thing is, what I really mean

Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen

This is meant to be a simpler way to play a highly complex song.  Not all the chords may sound 100%
true to the record, but that was not my goal in this tab.  Some of the chords may look more difficult
at first for beginners, but most of them are actually a lot easier to play than they look.  Authors, please
refrain from complexifying any part of the song if you can help it.  I'm 100% open to changes but want to
keep this simple.  There are far more accurate tabs if that is something you're looking for.  Thank you,
and I hope you enjoy!

Open your eyes

Look up to the skies and see

[Verse]
 
G          Em
Mama, just killed a man,
      Am
Put a gun against his head,
          Am                 D
Pulled my trigger, now he's dead,
G              Em
Mama, life had just begun,

But now I've gone and thrown it all  away

Mama ooooh,

If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
      G         Am        Fm                C
Carry on, carry on, as if nothing really matters

[Verse]
 
G            Em
Too late, my time has come,
      Am
Sends shivers down my spine
       Am               D
Body's aching all the time,
G                        Em
Goodbye everybody - I've got to go
      Am              Am/G#    Am/G Am/F#    Am/F Am/E
Gotta leave you all behind and face   the truth
C    G Am
Mama ooooh (any way the wind blows)
Dm
I don't want to die,
  G                                      C
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all

  Like when you said you felt so happy you could die

  Told myself that you were right for me

Am            G           Am      G        Am    G  Am  G
You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness
Am          G             Am
  Like resignation to the end
G          Am  G  Am  G
Always the end
Am           G                   Am       G
  So when we found that we could not make sense
Am         G                  Am       G
  Well you said that we would still be friends
Am           G              Am        G       Am  G  Am  G
  But I'll admit that I was glad that it was over

  But you didn't have to cut me off
Am         G             F
  Make out like it never happened
         G          Am
And that we were nothing
    G            F         G
And I don't even need your love
        Am              G
But you treat me like a stranger

And that feels so rough

  You didn't have to stoop so low
Am          G                    F
  Have your friends collect your records

And then change your number

I guess that I don't need that though

These songs of freedom,  songs of freedom

[Verse 1]
G
  Right from the start
             C                 Em
You were a thief, you stole my heart
    C                 G
And I your willing victim
  G                                C                      Em
I let you see the parts of me that weren't all that pretty
         C                      G
And with every touch you fixed them
 
 
[Pre-chorus 1]
    Em             D    A/C#    D      Dsus4
Now you've been talking in your sleep, oh oh
Em           D   A/C#   D   Dsus4
Things you never say to me, oh oh
Em           D      A/C# D
Tell me that you've had enough
G      C     G/B Dsus4  D
Of our love, our love
 
 
[Chorus]
G                             D/F#
Just give me a reason, just a little bit's enough
       Em                             Bm
Just a second, we're not broken, just bent
           Dsus4             G
And we can learn to love again
                             D/F#                         Em
It's in the stars, it's been written in the scars on our hearts
                       Bm
We're not broken, just bent
           Dsus4             G
And we can learn to love again
 
 
[Verse 2]
    G                               C                     Em
I'm sorry, I don't understand where all of this is coming from
  C                     G
I thought that we were fine
 
(Oh, we had everything)
     G                              C                  Em
Your head is running wild again, my dear we still have everything
    C                 G
And it's all in your mind
 
(Yeah, but this is happening)
 
 
[Pre-chorus 2]
Em            D    A/C#     D       Dsus4
You've been having real bad dreams, oh oh
    Em          D  A/C#     D   Dsus4
You used to lie so close to me, oh oh
        Em           D    A/C#  D
There's nothing more than empty sheets
  G         C     G/B Am           C     G/B Dsus4  D
Between our love, our love, oh our love, our love
 
 
[Chorus]
G                             D/F#
Just give me a reason, just a little bit's enough
       Em                             Bm
Just a second, we're not broken, just bent

And we can learn to love again
                              D/F#                        Em
I never stopped, you're still written in the scars on my heart
                        Bm
You're not broken, just bent
           Dsus4           Em
And we can learn to love again
 
 
[Bridge]
(Em)                Bm
Oh, tear ducts and rust
                 C
I'll fix it for us
                  D                      Em
We're collecting dust but our love's enough
                   Bm                    C
You're holding it in, you're pouring a drink
                  Am7    Dsus4 D
No, nothing is as bad as it    seems
N.C.
We'll come clean
 
 
[Chorus]
N.C.
Just give me a reason, just a little bit's enough
Just a second, we're not broken, just bent
And we can learn to love again
It's in the stars, it's been written in the scars on our hearts
That we're not broken, just bent
And we can learn to love again
 
 
[Chorus]
G                             D/F#
Just give me a reason, just a little bit's enough
       Em                             Bm
Just a second, we're not broken, just bent

It's in the stars, it's been written in the scars on our hearts

That we're not broken, just bent

And we can learn to love again
 
 
[Outro]

Ohh-ohh, we can learn to love again
     Bm         Dsus4             G
Ohh-ohh, we can learn to love again

Am                        G
   Hello darkness, my old friend,
                            Am
I've come to talk with you again,
                      F      C
Because a vision softly creeping,
                        F       C
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
        F                             C
And the vision that was planted in my brain
            C/B Am    C
Still remains
           G        Am
Within the sound of silence.
 
[Verse 2]
                             G
In restless dreams I walked alone
                        Am
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
                    F        C
'neath the halo of a street lamp,
                          F         C
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
        F                                         C
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
                    C/B Am    C
That split the night
                G        Am
And touched the sound of silence.
 
[Verse 3]
                         G
And in the naked light I saw
                           Am
Ten thousand people, maybe more.
                    F       C
People talking without speaking,
                    F       C
People hearing without listening,
               F                         C
People writing songs that voices never share
               C/B Am    C
And no one dare
            G        Am
Disturb the sound of silence.
 
[Verse 4]
                         G
Fools said I, you do not know
                      Am
Silence like a cancer grows.
                      F           C
Hear my words that I might teach you,
                     F           C
Take my arms that I might reach you.
       F                           C        C/B Am
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
    C             G        Am
And echoed in the wells of silence
 
[Verse 5]
                         G
And the people bowed and prayed
                     Am
To the neon God they made.
                          F      C
And the sign flashed out its warning,
                      F      C
In the words that it was forming.
                       F
And the sign said, the words of the prophets
                           C
Are written on the subway walls
                  C/B Am
And tenement halls
    C                G         Am
And whisper'd in the sounds of silence.

Dm             Bb     F           C
   When you're at the end of the road
Dm         Bb       F            C
   And you lost all sense of control
Dm          Bb            F            C
   And your thoughts have taken their toll
          Bb                             C
When your mind breaks the spirit of your soul
Dm      Bb             F       C
   Your faith walks on broken glass
Dm         Bb       F        C
   And the hangover doesn't pass
Dm           Bb   F         C
   Nothing's ever built to last
           Bb         C5
You're in ruins.
 
 
[Chorus]
F5   C/E  D5
One, 21 guns
C5             Bb5
Lay down your arms
F5           C5
Give up the fight
F5   C/E  D5
One, 21 guns
C5             Bb5 F5        C5
Throw up your arms into the sky,
        Bb5  F5  C5
You and I
 
 
[Bridge]
D5         Bb5    F5            C5
   Did you try to live on your own
D5          Bb5             F5         A5
   When you burned down the house and home?
D5         Bb5       F5            A5
   Did you stand too close to the fire?
       Bb5                  C5              F5
Like a liar looking for forgiveness from a stone

Dm Bb F C
 
 
[Verse]
Dm           Bb      F             C
   When it's time to live and let die
Dm         Bb         F       C
   And you can't get another try
Dm           Bb          F          C
   Something inside this heart has died
           Bb
You're in ruins.

[Verse 1]
Am               G                C    F
  I thought that I've been hurt before
    Am            G                  C    F
But no one's ever left me quite this sore
Am               G             C    F
  Your words cut deeper than a knife
      Am              G                  C    F
Now I need someone to breathe me back to life
 
[Pre-Chorus]
F                        G
  Got a feeling that I'm going under
Am                     G
  But I know that I'll make it out alive
F                   G
  If I quit calling you my lover
Am
  Move on
 
[Chorus]
             Am                         G
You watch me bleed until I can't breathe
             C
I'm shaking, falling onto my knees
F              Am               G
  And now that I'm without your kisses
F               C
I'll be needing stitches
Am                   G
Tripping over myself, aching
C
begging you to come help

[Verse 2]
Am            G               C    F
  Just like a moth drawn to a flame
        Am             G                  C    F
Oh, you lured me in, I couldn't sense the pain
Am            G                 C
  Your bitter heart cold to the touch
F               Am
  Now I'm gonna reap what I sow
G                 C            F
  I'm left seeing red on my own

The club isn't the best place to find a lover so the bar is where I go
Bm                       Em                           G                      A
Me and my friends at the table doing shots, drinking fast and then we talk slow
     Bm                         Em                      G                        A
Come over and start up a conversation with just me and trust me I'll give it a chance now
        Bm                      Em                      G                A
Take my hand, stop! Put Van the man on the jukebox and then we start to dance and now I'm singing like
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
Bm               Em
Girl, you know I want your love
G                       A                Bm
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
             Em
Come on now, follow my lead
G               A
I may be crazy, don't mind me, say
Bm             Em
Boy, let's not talk too much
G                    A                Bm
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
             Em
Come on now, follow my lead
  G                      N.C.
Come—come on now, follow my lead
 
 
[Chorus]

  I'm in love with the shape of you

  We push and pull like a magnet do
              Em               G
  Although my heart is falling too
          A
  I'm in love with your body
Bm          Em                   G
  And last night you were in my room
             A                    Bm
  And now my bedsheets smell like you
                    Em                  G
  Every day discovering something brand new
               A

[Verse 2]
Bm                    Em
One week in we let the story begin
            G                A
We're going out on our first date
            Bm                  Em
But you and me are thrifty so go all you can eat
             G                   A
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
            Bm                        Em
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
             G                A
And how your family is doin' okay
              Bm                Em
And leave and get in a taxi, we kiss in the backseat
          G                     A
Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]

is a great acoustic version of this song that I based this tab off.
In the chorus a B or B7 is fine depending if you're playing the original or acoustic version.
 
B7  = x2120x in Hozier's version

G5  = 35xxxx

Knows everybody's disapproval

[Verse 1]
Bm       G              D         A
Feeling my way through the darkness
Bm       G          D         A
Guided by a beating heart 
Bm       G              D         A
I can't tell where the journey will end 
Bm       G          D         A
But I know where it starts 
Bm       G              D         A
They tell me I'm too young to understand,
Bm       G          D         A
They say I'm caught up in a dream 
Bm       G              D         A
Well life will pass me by if I don't open up my eyes
Bm       G          D         A
Well that's fine by me
 
[Chorus]

I tried carrying the weight of the world

But I only have two hands
Bm       G              D         A
Hope I get the chance to travel the world

Not afraid to close my eyes

Life's a game made for everyone
Bm       G          D         A
And love is the prize

Now that she's back in the atmosphere

She acts like summer and walks like rain

My mama went off and left him, she wanted more from life than he could give,
         Cmaj7                  G
I said, ""Somebody's got to take care of him.""
   Em                       D
So I quit school and that's what I did.

Cmaj7          G
You got a fast car.
          Em                    D
But is it fast enough so we can fly away?
Cmaj7             G
We gotta make a decision:
Em                        D
Leave tonight or live and die this way.

Em      C                    Em*              C
 So I remember when: we were driving, driving in your car,
    Em*                       C
The speed so fast I felt like I was drunk,
Em              C
City lights lay out before us
         Em                     C
And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder. 
    C Em      D
And I   had a feeling that I belonged
    C Em      D                  Em          C           Em

Cmaj7          G

And we go cruising to entertain ourselves;
Cmaj7                 G
you still ain't got a job
      Em                    D
And I work in a market as a checkout girl.
Cmaj7                  G
I know things will get better:
Em                   D
You'll find work and I'll get promoted, 
Cmaj7                 G
We'll move out of the shelter
Em                     D
Buy a bigger house and live in the suburbs.

You got a fast car.
    Em               D
And I got a job that pays all our bills.
Cmaj7                 G
You stay out drinking late at the bar,
        Em                         D
You see more your friends than you do your kids.
Cmaj7                G
I'd always hoped for better,
Em                     D
Thought maybe together you and me would find it,
Cmaj7                  G
I got no plans I ain't going nowhere,
   Em                     D
so take your fast car and keep on driving.

          D
When the days are cold
         A
And the cards all fold
         Bm
And the saints we see
         G
Are all made of gold
            D
When your dreams all fail
         A
And the ones we hail
         Bm
Are the worst of all
          G
And the blood’s run stale
 
[Pre-Chorus]
D                    A
  I wanna hide the truth
                 Bm
I wanna shelter you
                      G
But with the beast inside
                        D
There’s nowhere we can hide
                    A
No matter what we breed
                       Bm
We still are made of greed

This is my kingdom come

This is my kingdom come

  When you feel my heat
              Bm
Look into my eyes

It’s where my demons hide

It’s where my demons hide
                A
Don’t get too close

It’s dark inside

It’s where my demons hide

It’s where my demons hide
 
[Verse 2]
        D
At the curtain’s call
          A
It's the last of all
          Bm
When the lights fade out
         G
All the sinners crawl
         D
So they dug your grave
         A
And the masquerade
           Bm
Will come calling out
        G
At the mess you made
 
[Pre-Chorus]
D                      A
  Don’t wanna let you down

But I am hellbound

Though this is all for you

Don’t wanna hide the truth

[Bridge]
(D)                     A
They say it’s what you make
                  Bm
I say it’s up to fate
                  G
It’s woven in my soul

I need to let you go

Your eyes, they shine so bright

I wanna save that light

I can’t escape this now

Unless you show me how

When you feel my heat

Look into my eyes

It’s where my demons hide

Don’t get too close

It’s dark inside

[Intro]
Am   Fmaj7   C   G
                 Hey!
Am   Fmaj7   C   G
                 Hey!
Am   Fmaj7   C   G
                 Hey!
Am   Fmaj7   C   G
 
[Verse 1]
Am           Fmaj7                  C
I don't like walking around this old and empty house
   Am                 F                C
So hold my hand, I'll walk with you my dear
    Am           Fmaj7              C
The stairs creak as you sleep, it's keeping me awake
         Am            F                 C
It's the house telling you to close your eyes
    Am        Fmaj7       C
And some days I can't even dress myself
     Am            F               C
It's killing me to see you this way
 
[Chorus]
                  Am        Fmaj7
'Cause though the truth may vary, this
C           G
  ship will carry our
Am     F            C
bodies safe to shore
 
[Interlude]
Am   Fmaj7   C   G
                 Hey!
Am   Fmaj7   C   G
                 Hey!
Am   Fmaj7   C   G
                 Hey!
Am   Fmaj7   C   G
 
[Verse 2]
           Am        Fmaj7            C
There's an old voice in my head that's holding me back
      Am              Fmaj7            C
Well, tell her that I miss our little talks
Am              Fmaj7    C
Soon it will be over and buried with our past
   Am              Fmaj7             C
We used to play outside when we were young (and full of life and full of love)
Am        Fmaj7           C
Some days I don't know if I am wrong or right
     Am              Fmaj7             C
Your mind is playing tricks on you my dear
 
[Chorus]
                  Am        Fmaj7
'Cause though the truth may vary, this
C            G
  ship will carry our
Am     Fmaj7        C
bodies safe to shore   Hey!
      Am          Fmaj7  C    G
Don't listen to a word I say. Hey!
    Am          Fmaj7     C     G
The screams all sound the same. Hey!
           Am        Fmaj7
Though the truth may vary, this
C           G
  ship will carry our

[Instrumental]
Am   Fmaj7   C   G
                 Hey!
Am   Fmaj7   C   G
                 Hey!
Am   Fmaj7   C   G
Am   Fmaj7   C   G
Am
 
[Verse 3]
       Am
You're gone, gone, gone away. I watched you disappear
Am
All that's left is a ghost of you
          Am
Now we're torn, torn, torn apart, there's nothing we can do
     Am
Just let me go, we'll meet again soon
    Am          Fmaj7       C
Now wait, wait, wait for me. Please hang around
     Am             Fmaj7 C
I'll see you when I fall asleep. Hey!
 
[Chorus]
      Am          Fmaj7  C    G
Don't listen to a word I say. Hey!
    Am          Fmaj7     C     G
The screams all sound the same. Hey!
           Am        Fmaj7

C           G
  ship will carry our
Am     Fmaj7        C  G

      Am          Fmaj7  C    G
Don't listen to a word I say. Hey!
    Am          Fmaj7     C     G
The screams all sound the same. Hey!
           Am        Fmaj7
Though the truth may vary, this
C           G

[Ending]
           Am        Fmaj7

[Verse 1]
Cadd9
Heartbeats fast

Colors and promises
          Em7
How to be brave
          D              Cadd9
How can I love when I'm afraid to fall

What's standing in front of me

I walked across an empty land
Dm                          Gsus4          G
I knew the pathway like the back of my hand

I felt the branches of it looking at me

Is this the place we used to love?

C      Am                 G
  Oh   thinking about our younger years
          Dm           Am
There was only you and me
         Bb                 G
We were young and wild and free
C     Am                    G
  Now nothing can take you away from me

Baby you're all that I want

When you're lying here in my arms
    F          G         Am             G
I'm finding it hard to believe we're in heaven

And love is all that I need
      C                      F
And I found it there in your heart
    F         G      Am              G

Who will turn your world around
          Bb                     G
Bring you up when you're feelin' down
C       Am                          G
  Yeah, nothing can change what you mean to me

Ohh, there's lots that I could say

[Verse 1]
          C                      Em         Am7       G
When you try your best but you don't succeed,
          C                      Em         Am7       G
When you get what you want, but not what you need,

When you feel so tired, but you can't sleep,

Stuck in reverse.
 
[Verse 2]

And the tears come streaming down your face,

When you lose something you can't replace,

When you love someone but it goes to waste,

Could it be worse?
 
[Chorus]

High up above or down below,
             C              Em       Am7       G
When you're too in love to let it go,
             C              Em        Am7      G
But if you never try you'll never know,
                  C    Em   Am7   G       F
Just what you're worth.
 
[Chorus]

When you lose something you cannot replace.
Am7          F                  C   G
Tears stream, down your face and I (hold).

[Verse 1]
  G                 Em
I heard there was a secret chord
      G                   Em
That David played and it pleased the Lord
    C                         D      G        D
But you don't really care for music, do you?
          G
Well, it goes like this
     C           D          Em                 C
The fourth, the fifth, the minor fall and the major lift
     D              B7           Em
The baffled king composing Hallelujah
 
[Chorus]
      C           Em        C          G    D/F#    G
Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah
 
[Verse 2]
           G                        Em
Well, your faith was strong but you needed proof
    G               Em
You saw her bathing on the roof
    C                        D     G        D
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you
    G               C        D
She tied you to her kitchen chair
    Em                        C
She broke your throne and she cut your hair
    D                  B7             Em
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah

G               Em
Baby, I've been here before
     G                       Em
I've seen this room and I've walked this floor
  C                    D       G        D
I used to live alone before I knew you
         G                     C      D
And I've seen your flag on the marble arch
    Em            C
And love is not a victory march
       D               B7           Em
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

            G                   Em
Well, there was a time when you let me know
G                   Em
What's really going on below
    C                       D      G        D
But now you never show that to me, do you?
      G             C        D
But remember when I moved in you
        Em            C
And the holy dove was moving too
    D               B7             Em
And every breath we drew was Hallelujah

[Verse 5]
G               Em
Maybe there's a God above
    G              Em
But all I've ever learned from love
    C                       D      G       D
Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew you
         G                  C       D
And it's not a cry that you hear at night
     Em                 C
It's not somebody who's seen the light
       D               B7           Em
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

[Bridge]
Am                                 G
Tryin' to fit your hand inside of mine
 
When we know it just don't belong
D
There's no force on earth
                   Em
Could make me feel right, no
Whoa
Am                                 G
Tryin' to push this problem up the hill
 
When it's just too heavy to hold
D                              Em
Think now's the time to let it slide
 
[Chorus]

So come on let it gooooooooo
            Em         D

Why don't you be youuuuuuuu
              D
And I'll be me

Leave it to the breeeeeeeeeeeze
               Am           G
Let the ashes faaaaaaaaalllll
              D
Forget about me
                  C         G
So come on let it gooooooooo
            Em         D
Just let it beeeeeeeeee
                 Am         G
Why don't you be youuuuuuuu

Song: Waktu Yang Salah
 
[Intro]
G  Am  Bm
 
[Verse 1]
  G             Am      Bm
Jangan tanyakan perasaanku
  C              Cm       Bm
Jika kau pun tak bisa beralih
  E                       Am Bm Cm
Dari masa lalu yang menghantuimu
    Am                     D
Karena sungguh ini tidak adil
 
[Verse 2]
  G            Am       Bm
Bukan maksudku menyakitimu
  C               Cm        Bm
Namun tak mudah untuk melupakan
    E                         Am  Bm Cm
Cerita panjang yang pernah aku lalui
  Am                D   G
Tolong yakinkan saja raguku
 
[Chorus]
      C                     C/D
Pergi saja engkau pergi dariku
       Bm                  Em
Biar kubunuh perasaan untukmu
      Am
Meski berat melangkah
  D                   G         Dm G
Hatiku hanya tak siap terluka
     C                     C/D
Beri kisah kita sedikit waktu
        Bm                   Em
Semesta mengirim dirimu untukku
     Am               D
Kita adalah rasa yang tepat
                 G
Di waktu yang salah
 
[Verse 3]
  G             Am      Bm
Hidup memang sebuah pilihan
  C         Cm            Bm
Tapi hati bukan untuk dipilih
    E                   Am  Bm Cm
Bila hanya setengah dirimu hadir
     Am         D         G
Dan setengah lagi untuk dia
 
[Chorus]
      C                     C/D
Pergi saja engkau pergi dariku
       Bm                  Em
Biar kubunuh perasaan untukmu
      Am
Meski berat melangkah
  D                   G         Dm G
Hatiku hanya tak siap terluka
     C                     C/D
Beri kisah kita sedikit waktu
        Bm                   Em
Semesta mengirim dirimu untukku
     Am               D
Kita adalah rasa yang tepat
                 G
Di waktu yang salah
 
[Bridge]
  Em           D   C
Bukan ini yang kumau
  Em           D     C
Lalu untuk apa kau datang?
   Em          D   C
Rindu tak bisa diatur
  Em            D     C
Kita tak pernah mengerti
    Em        D  C  D
Kau dan aku menyakitkan
 
[Chorus]
      C                     C/D
Pergi saja engkau pergi dariku
       Bm                  Em
Biar kubunuh perasaan untukmu
      Am
Meski berat melangkah
  D                   G         Dm G
Hatiku hanya tak siap terluka
     C                     C/D
Beri kisah kita sedikit waktu
        Bm                   Em
Semesta mengirim dirimu untukku
     Am               D
Kita adalah rasa yang tepat
                 G
Di waktu yang salah

[Verse 1]
G
Going out tonight, changes into something red
Em7
  Her mother doesn't like that kind of dress
Bm
Everything she never had
                 D
She’s showing off
G
Driving too fast, moon is breaking through her hair
Em7
  She's heading for something that she won’t forget
Bm                                              D
  Having no regrets is all that she really wants
 
[Chorus]
C                    D
  We're only getting older baby
C                         D
  And I've been thinking about it lately
C              D
  Does it ever drive you crazy
G        D/F#        Em
Just how fast the night changes
C                        D
  Everything that you've ever dreamed of
C              D
  Disappearing when you wake up
C                        D
  But there’s nothing to be afraid of
G    D/F#        Em
Even when the night changes
C               D             G
  It will never change me and you
 
[Verse 2]
G
Chasing her tonight, doubts are running ‘round her head
Em7
  He’s waiting, hides behind his cigarette
Bm                                                D
Heart is beating loud, she doesn't want it to stop
G
Moving too fast, moon is lighting up her skin
Em7
  She’s falling, doesn't even know it yet
Bm                                        D
Having no regrets is all that she really wants
 
[Chorus]
C                    D
  We're only getting older baby
C                        D
  And I've been thinking about it lately
C              D
  Does it ever drive you crazy
G        D/F#        Em
Just how fast the night changes
C                        D
  Everything that you've ever dreamed of
C              D
  Disappearing when you wake up
C                        D
  But there’s nothing to be afraid of
G    D/F#        Em
Even when the night changes
C               D             A
  It will never change me and you
 
[Breakdown]
A  F#m  D E
 
[Bridge]
A
  Going out tonight, changes into something red
F#m
  Her mother doesn't like that kind of dress
  C#m                                            E
Reminds her of a missing piece of innocence she lost
 
[Final Chorus]
D                    E
  We're only getting older baby
D                         E
  And I've been thinking about it lately
D              E
  Does it ever drive you crazy
A        E/G#       F#m
Just how fast the night changes
D                        E
  Everything that you've ever dreamed of
D              E
  Disappearing when you wake up
D                         E
   But there’s nothing to be afraid of
A    E/G#        F#m
Even when the night changes
D                        E
  Everything that you've ever dreamed of
D              E
  Disappearing when you wake up
D                      E
But there’s nothing to be afraid of
A    E/G#        F#m
Even when the night changes
 
[Outro]
D               E
  It will never change, baby
D               E
  We will never change, baby
D               E             A
  It will never change me and you

Em                        G
How do I live without the ones I love?
Am                                Em/G          D
Time still turns the pages of the book, it's burned
Em                    G
Place and time always on my mind
        Am
And the light you left remains
          C         D
But it so hard to stay
      Am                                C     D    Em
And I have so much to say and you're so far away

But I'll see you

[Chorus 1]
Em                      G
Once I was seven years old
              C
my momma told me
                                           D
go make yourself some friends or you'll be lonely
Em                      G           C
once I was seven years old
 
[Verse 1]
Em            D   G
It was a big big world
                                C
but we thought we were bigger
 
Pushing each other to the limits
         D                  Em
we were learning quicker
          D      G
By eleven smoking herb
                             C
and drinking burning liquor
                                       D
Never rich so we were out to make that steady figure
 
[Chorus 2]
Em                D     G
Once I was eleven years old
              C
my daddy told me
                                    D
go get yourself a wife or you'll be lonely
Em                D     G     C
Once I was eleven years old
 
[Verse 2]
Em            D    G
I always have that dream
                         C
like my Daddy before me
 
So I started writing songs
          D                Em
I started writing stories
                     D  G
Something about that glory
                              C
just always seemed to bore me
 
Cause only those I really love
          D
will ever really know me
 
[Chorus 3]
Em                D     G
Once I was twenty years old
             C
my story got told
                                      D
before the morning sun, when life was lonely
Em                D     G     C
Once I was twenty years old
 
[Verse 3]
Em           D  G
  I only see my goals
                              C
I don't believe in failure
 
Cause I know the smallest voices
         D               Em
they can make it major
              D   G                           C
I got my boys with me at least those in favor
 
and if we don´t meet before I leave
         D
I hope I see you later
 
[Chorus 4]
Em                D     G
Once I was twenty years old
             C
my story got told
 
I was writing about everything
        D
I saw before me
Em                D     G       C
Once I was twenty years old
 
[Chorus 5]
Em               D     G
Soon we´ll be 30 years old
                    C
our songs have been sold
 
we've traveled around the world
                D
and we´re still roaming
Em               D     G      C
Soon we´ll be 30 years old
 
[Bridge]
Em                           G
I´m still learning about life
                                C
my woman brought children for me
 
so I can sing them all my songs
          D
and I can tell them stories
Em
  Most of my boys are with me
G                               C
some are still out seeking glory
 
And some I had to leave behind
            G/B
my brother, I´m still sorry
 
[Chorus 6]
C                  D     Em
Soon I´ll be sixty years old
                   D
my daddy got sixty-one
                            G/B
remember life and then your life
 
becomes a better one
C
  I made a man so happy
D              Em
when I wrote a letter once
Bsus4                       B
I hope my children come and visit
 
once or twice a month
 
[Chorus 7]
C                  D     Em
Soon I´ll be sixty years old
                          D
will I think the world is cold
                        G/B
or will I have a lot of children who can warm me
C                  D     Em      C
Soon I´ll be sixty years old
 
[Chorus 7]

[Intro]
G  D/F#  Em  C  G
 
 
[Verse 1]
G
White lips, pale face,
              D/F# Em
Breathing in snowflakes,
              C    G
Burnt lungs, sour taste.
G
Light's gone, day's end
               D    Em
Struggling to pay rent,
               C      G
Long nights, strange men.
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
      Am                         Cadd9
And they say she's in the Class A Team,
              G
Stuck in her daydream,
                     D                  Am
Been this way since 18, but lately her face seems
                  Cadd9
Slowly sinking, wasting
                G
Crumbling like pastries
 
And they scream
     D
The worst things in life come free to us,
 
 
[Chorus]
          Em              Cadd9
Cuz we're just under the upper hand
G
And go mad for a couple grams
Em                  Cadd9      G
And she don't want to go outside tonight
          Em                    Cadd9
And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland
  G
Or sells love to another man,
Em        Cadd9     G
It's too cold outside
    D         Em      C    G
For angels to fly
            Em      C    G
Angels to fly
 
 
[Verse 2]
G
Ripped gloves, and raincoat,
                    D    Em
Tried to swim and stay afloat,
            C    G
Dry house, wet clothes.
G
Loose change, bank notes,
              D    Em
Weary-eyed, dry throat,
            C   G
Call girl, no phone.
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
     Am                          Cadd9

For angels to fly,
 
 
[Bridge]
                C
An angel will die.
              Em
Covered in white,
 
Closed eye,
     G
And hoping for a better life,
  Am                       C
This time, we'll fade out tonight
                   Em  C  G
Straight down the line
 
Em  C  G

And they say she's in the Class A Team,

Stuck in her daydream,

Been this way since 18, but lately her face seems

     D
The worst things in life come free to us,
 
 
[Final Chorus]
Em                      Cadd9
Cuz we're all under the upper hand,
G
And go mad for a couple grams,
Em                    Cadd9   G
And we don't want to go outside tonight,

 G
Or sell love to another man
Em         Cadd9    G
It's too cold outside,
    D         Em    C    G
For angels to fly
            Em  C  G
Angels to fly
   Em  C   G
To fly, fly
           Em      C       G
Angels to fly, to fly, to fly
D          G
Angels to die.

Headed down south to the land of the pines

Starin' up the road

And pray to God I see headlights

I made it down the coast in seventeen hours
Em                      C
Pickin' me a bouquet of dogwood flowers

I was born to be a fiddler in an old-time stringband

Oh, the North country winters keep a gettin' me now

Lost my money playin' poker so I had to up and leave

Walkin' to the south out of Roanoke

I caught a trucker out of Philly

Had a nice long toke

But he's a headed west from the Cumberland Gap

To Johnson City, Tennessee

And I gotta get a move on before the sun

  He’s the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
Em                             C
  The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
G                      D                              Em       C

Em                      C
  So I drive home alone, as I turn out the light
G                             D
  I put his picture down, and maybe get some sleep tonight
 
 
[Chorus]
 
G                               D
  Cause he’s the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
Em                        C
  The only one who’s got enough of me to break my heart
 
G                      D                              Em       C
  He’s the song in the car I keep singing, don’t know why I do
          G                           D
He’s the time, taken up, but there’s never enough
         Em                      C
And he’s all that I need to fall into

Cause everything that you thought I would be

Hint: starting with the C the bass tones should ascend till G/B and then go back down to C. The ascendance
of the bass tones is crucial for the intensification of this part.

[Verse 1]
C             E7              Am
This is the first day of my life
F             G                 C
Swear I was born right in the doorway
C                   E7                        Am
I went out in the rain, suddenly everything changed
                D7              G        G7
They're spreading blankets on the beach
 
C              E7                Am
Yours is the first face that I saw
F             G              C
Think I was blind before I met you
C                        E7                          Am
Now I don't know where I am, I don't know where I've been
           D7              G      G7
But I know where I want to go
 
[Chorus]
         C           G       Am
And so I thought I'd let you know
      F                 G
Yeah, these things take forever
    C    E      Am
I especially am slow
        Dmadd9
But I realized that I need you and I wondered if I could come home

[Verse 2]
C            E7                 Am
Remember the time you drove all night
F        G             C
Just to meet me in the morning
C                    E7                           Am
And I thought it was strange, you said everything changed
            D7                 G     G7
You felt as if you'd just woke up
           C               E7              Am
And you said, ""This is the first day of my life.
F                   G            C
I'm glad I didn't die before I met you.
C                E7                  Am
But now I don't care, I could go anywhere with you,
        D7            G        G7
And I'd probably be happy.""
 
[Chorus]
          C     G       Am
So if you wanna be with me
     F                       G
With these things there's no telling
        C       E         Am
We just have to wait and see
                  Dmadd9
But I'd rather be working for a paycheck
 
Than waiting to win the lottery
 
C E7/B Am7
             Dmadd9
Besides, maybe this time it's different,
                                C
I mean I really think you like me

I made it down the coast in seventeen hours
Em                       C
Picking me a bouquet of dogwood flowers
          G                          D             C
And I'm a-hopin' for Raleigh, I can see my baby tonight
 
 
[Chorus]
    G                    D
So rock me momma like a wagon wheel
Em                C
Rock me momma any way you feel
 G  D        C
Hey,  momma rock me
 G                      D
Rock me momma like the wind and the rain

 G                    D
Running from the cold up in New England
      Em                         C
I was born to be a fiddler in an old time string band
   G                   D               C
My baby plays a guitar, I pick a banjo now
     G                            D
Oh, north country winters keep a-getting me down
         Em                       C
Lost my money playing poker so I had to leave town
      G                      D                   C
But I ain't turning back to living that old life no more

Walkin' to the south out of Roanoke
            Em                           C
I caught a trucker out of Philly, had a nice long toke
     G                            D
But he's a heading west from the Cumberland gap
    C
To Johnson City, Tennessee
   G                   D
I gotta get a move on before the sun
           Em                         C
I hear my baby calling my name and I know that she's the only one
    G                       D              C

  G                                    C
A day or two ago, I thought I'd take a ride
    Am              D7                      G
And soon Miss Fanny Bright was seated by my side
    G                                              C
The horse was lean and lank, misfortune seemed his lot
   Am         D                D7             G    D7
We ran into a drifted bank and there we got upsot. Oh!
 
[Chorus]
G                                  C       G
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way!

Oh what fun it is to ride
     A7             D7
In a one-horse open sleigh, hey!
G                                  C       G
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way!
C              G
Oh what fun it is to ride

In a one-horse open sleigh!
 
[Verse]
  G                                C
A day or two ago, the story I must tell
   Am              D7                    G
I went out on the snow and on my back I fell
                                          C
A gent was riding by in a one-horse open sleigh
    Am            D              D7                G      D7
He laughed at me as I there lay but quickly drove away.  Oh!

G                                           C
Now the ground is white, go it while you're young
Am              D7                           G
Take the girls along and sing this sleighing song
     G                                     C
Just bet a bobtailed bay, two forty as his speed
Am              D               D7                     G     D7
Hitch him to an open sleigh and crack! you'll take the lead. Oh!

Em    Em   D6/9  D6/9  x2
 
[Verse 1]
       Em                D6/9
On the first part of the journey
      Em                 D6/9
I was looking at all the life
           Em                   D6/9
There were plants and birds and rocks and things
           Em                 D6/9
There were sand and hills and rings
    Em                      D6/9
The first thing I met was a fly with a buzz
        Em            D6/9
And the sky with no clouds
    Em                    D6/9
The heat was hot and the ground was dry
        Em                D6/9
But the air was full of sound
 
 
[Chorus]
     Em9                          Dmaj9
I've been through the desert on a horse with no name
        Em9                   Dmaj9
It felt good to be out of the rain
        Em9              Dmaj9
In the desert you can remember your name
              Em9                Dmaj9
'Cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain
Em9         Dmaj9
La, la, la lala la la la, la, la
Em9         Dmaj9
La, la, la lala la la la, la, la
 
 
[Verse 2]
      Em              D6/9
After two days in the desert sun
    Em                D6/9
My skin began to turn red
       Em               D6/9
After three days in the desert fun
      Em                 D6/9
I was looking at a river bed
        Em                 D6/9
And the story it told of a river that flowed
        Em                  D6/9
Made me sad to think it was dead
 
 
[Chorus]
             Em9                          Dmaj9
You see I've been through the desert on a horse with no name
         Em9                  Dmaj9
It felt good to be out of the rain
       Em9             Dmaj9
In the desert you can remember your name
       Em9                       Dmaj9

[Verse 3]
      Em                  D6/9
After nine days I let the horse run free
           Em                   D6/9
'Cause the desert had turned to sea
           Em                   D6/9
There were plants and birds and rocks and things
           Em                 D6/9
There were sand and hills and rings
    Em                         D6/9
The ocean is a desert with its life underground
      Em               D6/9
And a perfect disguise above
          Em            D6/9
Under the cities lies a heart made of ground
        Em                  D6/9
But the humans will give no love
 
 
[Chorus]
              Em9                          Dmaj9
You see, I've been through the desert on a horse with no name

It felt good to be out of the rain

Walking down 29th and Park
Am7        F            C
I saw you in another’s arms
Am7       F               C

Saw you walk inside a bar

He said something to make you laugh
Am7          F                      C

Everything’s reminding me of you
Am7         F     C                                Am7
Nursing an empty bottle and telling myself you’re happier
F      C
Aren’t you?
 
[Pre-Chorus 2]
Am7            F              C
Ain’t nobody hurt you like I hurt you
     Am7            F              C
But ain’t nobody need you like I do
Am7                  F              C
I know that there’s others that deserve you
        Am7            F                  C
But my darling, I am still in love with you
 
[Chorus]
                     Am7     F     C
But I guess you look happier, you do
                       Am7      F         C
My friends told me one day I’ll feel it too
                Am7       F         C
I could try to smile to hide the truth
                 Am7     F      C
But I know I was happier with you
 
[Interlude]
(Hey-yeah, hey-yeah, hey-yeah)
Am7   F   C     x4
 
[Outro]
                Am7    F     C
Baby, you look happier, you do
                     Am7       F       C
I knew one day you’d fall for someone new
                      Am7        F       C
But if he breaks your heart like lovers do
                       Am7        F       C
Just know that I’ll be waiting here for you

       G                    C
All my bags are packed, I'm ready to go
    G                C
I'm standing here outside your door
G                   C             D
I hate to wake you up to say goodbye
        G                      C
But the dawn is breaking, it's early morn,
    G                    C
The taxi's waiting, he's blowing his horn
G               C                D
Already I'm so lonesome I could die

There's so many times I've let you down

So many times I've played around

 I tell you now they don't mean a thing

Every song I sing I'll sing for you

One more time let me kiss you

Then close your eyes I'll be on my way
G               C
Dream about the days to come

When I won't have to leave alone

About the times I won't have to say

 Nice to meet you where you been

You can tell me when it's over mmm

If the high was worth the pain
 
Got a long list of ex-lovers
                           G
They'll tell you I'm insane
                                                       D
Cause you know I love the players and you love the game
 
D
Cause we're young and we're reckless
                           Bm
We'll take this way too far
 
 It'll leave you breathless, mmm
                    Em
Or with a nasty scar
 
 Got a long list of ex-lovers

Cherry lips, crystal skies

Stolen kisses, pretty lies

You're the king baby I'm your queen
 
Find out what you want
 
Be that girl for a month
A7sus4                     A
Wait the worst is yet to come, oh no
 
 D
Screaming crying perfect storms
                          Bm
I can make all the tables turn
 
Rose garden filled with thorns
 
Keep you second guessing
      G
Like ""Oh my God who is she?""
 
I get drunk on jealousy
    A
But you'll come back each time you leave
                               G N.C.

That David played, and it pleased the Lord

I remember you said, Don't leave me here a - lone

I pluck/tap when I play it like this: http://www.liveloveguitar.com/ed-sheeran-thinking-loud-guitar-chords/

Am7 [x02010] -  If you can't hear a difference between the C and
  C [032010]    Am7, make SURE you're strumming both chords
                correctly- you HAVE to strum the A string with
                each chord.
 
**********************************************************************************
 
NOTE- When transposed up 2x's to remove the capo, use D/F# for the Bm7 (Am7).
      A C/E sounds the same as a C so it didn't work for this CAPO ON 2 version.
      And I repeat-  THIS IS A CAPO ON 2 VERSION!!!

C          Am7
 When your legs don't work 
          F             G
Like they used to before
C            Am7                   F    G
 And I can't sweep you off of your feet
C          Am7
 Will your mouth still remember 
    F               G
The taste of my love
C          Am7
 Will your eyes still smile 
F               G
From your cheeks                        
            C  Am7           F    G              C   Am7  F  G

           C   Am7                   F  G           C    Am7

Well me I fall in love with you every single day

C        Am7                       F           G
 When my hairs all but gone and my memory fades
C        Am7                      F    G
 And the crowds don't remember my name
C        Am7         F                    G           C
 When my hands don't play the strings the same way, mmm
       Am7                        F    G
I know you will still love me the same
              C   Am7             F    G                 C  Am7  F  G
Cause honey your soul could never grow old it's evergreen
           C    Am7           F     G            C  Am7  F
And baby your smile's forever in my mind and memory

I'm thinking 'bout how
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
 
Dm                       G        C
People fall in love in mysterious ways
    Dm                       G
And maybe it's all part of a plan
     Dm                           Am     Am7
Well I'll just keep on making the same mistakes 
Dm                      G
Hoping that you'll understand

          C    Am7 F

So, if you want to play like her, then
click the transpose down arrow 2 times (-2)

the capo on the 6th fret!
 
*Note - Taylor plays the G as [320010]; a regular G
works just fine though.

Once upon a time, a few mistakes ago
A
I was in your sights, you got me alone
    Bm                          G
You found me, you found me, you found me-e-e-e-e
 
  D
I guess you didn't care, and I guess liked that
    A
And when I fell hard, you took a step back

Without me, without me, without me-e-e-e-e

C
  I found myself dreaming
Em
  In silver and gold
Am
  Like a scene from a movie
     F     Em     Dm    G
That every broken heart knows
 
C
  We were walking on moonlight
Em
  And you pulled me close
Am
  Split second and you disappeared

And then I was all alone
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]

I woke up in tears with you by my side
Em
Breath of relief

And I realized

No, we're not promised tomorrow

C
  In the blink of an eye
Em
  Just a whisper of smoke
Am
  You could lose everything
    F     Em     Dm    G
The truth is you never know
 
C
  So I'll kiss you longer baby
Em
  Any chance that I get
Am
  And I'll make the most of the minutes

Let's take our time to say what we want

Use what we got before it's all gone

C                   C/B
  Coming out of my cage

And I've been doing just fine  
 
Gotta gotta be down
 
Because I want it all
C                       C/B
  It started out with a kiss

How did it end up like this? 
 
It was only a kiss
 
It was only a kiss
C                   C/B
  Now I'm falling asleep

And she's calling a cab  
 
While he's having a smoke
 
And she's taking the drag

  Now they're going to bed

[Verse 1]
D                D/F#  G                  Bm   A
  When I was six years old I broke my leg
D               D/F# G                    Bm         A
  And I was running  from my brother and his friends
D            D/F#  G                   Bm                 A
  And tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass as I rolled down
D           D/F#  G   Bm                 A
  I was younger  then,  take me back to when I
 
 
[Pre-Chorus 1]
G           A                  D
  Found my heart and broke it here
                    G
  Made friends and lost them through the years
G               A                D                  G
  And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long, I know I've grown
G              A
  But I can't wait to go home
 
 
[Chorus 1]
  D      D/F# G    Bm         A7sus4
  I'm on my   way, driving at ninety
       D         D/F# G     Bm         A7sus4
  Down those country  lanes singing to Tiny Dancer
      D      D/F# G           Bm       A7sus4
  And I miss the  way you make  me feel      and it's real

D         D/F#  G               Bm                     A
  Fifteen years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes

  Running from the law through the backfields and  getting drunk with my friends
D        D/F#   G                Bm             A
  Had my first kiss on a Friday night, I don't reckon I did it

[Pre-Chorus 2]
G          A                    D
  Weekend jobs and when we got paid
                  G                      G
  We'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight
             A                       D              G
  Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long, oh how we've grown

Bm              G                   D       A7sus4
   One had two kids but lives alone, one's brother overdosed

   One's already on his second wife, one's just barely getting by but
Bm               G                  D       A7sus4
   These people raised me and I-I-I, can't wait to go home
 
 
[Chorus 3]
      D      D/F# G    Bm        A7sus4
  And I'm on my   way, I still remember
        D       D/F# G          Bm         A7sus4
  These old country  lanes when we did not know the answers

  And I miss the  way you make  me feel      and it's real

[Verse 1]
E      B             C#m           A
Just a small town girl, living in a lonely world
E           B                     G#m   A
She took the midnight train going anywhere
E      B      C#m                   A
Just a city boy, born and raised in south Detroit
E          B                     G#m   A
He took the midnight train going anywhere
 
E  B  C#m  A
E  B  G#m  A
 
E             B        C#m                    A
A singer in a smoky room, a smell of wine and cheap perfume
E                    B                        G#m           A
For a smile they can share the night, it goes on and on and on and on
 
[Chorus]
A                 E
Strangers waiting up and down the boulevard
 A                      E
Their shadows searching in the night
A                    E
Streetlights, people, living just to find emotion
A                        B  E   B  E  A
Hiding, somewhere in the night
 
E  B  C#m  A
 
[Verse 2]
E               B         C#m          A
Working hard to get my fill, everybody wants a thrill
       E           B                   G#m      A
Paying anything to roll the dice, just one more time
E              B               C#m               A
Some will win, some will lose, some were born to sing the blues
 E            B                   G#m           A
Oh, the movie never ends; it goes on and on and on and on

Don't stop believing hold on to the feeling

Streetlight people

My girl, my girl, don't lie to me

Tell me where did you sleep last night

In the pines, in the pines

Just about a mile from here
    E                   A       G
His head was found in a driving wheel

[Verse 1]
 
G
White lips, pale face
               D/F# Em
Breathing in snowflakes
              C    G
Burnt lungs, sour taste
G
Light's gone, day's end
              D/F# Em
Struggling to pay rent
                C    G
Long nights, strange men

And they say
                   C
She's in the Class A Team
               G
Stuck in her daydream
                    D/F#
Been this way since 18
                Am
But lately her face seems
                 C
Slowly sinking, wasting
                G
Crumbling like pastries
 
And they scream
     D/F#
The worst things in life come free to us
 
 
[Chorus]
 
            Em            C
Cos we're just under the upperhand
G
And go mad for a couple grams
Em                    C      G
And she don't want to go outside tonight
          Em                    C
And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland
G
Or sells love to another man
Em        C       G
It's too cold outside
     D        Em  C  G
For angels to fly
           Em  C  G
Angels to fly
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
G
Ripped gloves, raincoat
                    D/F#  Em
Tried to swim and stay afloat
            C   G
Dry house, wet clothes
G
Loose change, bank notes
             D/F# Em
Weary-eyed, dry throat
           C    G
Call girl, no phone

(Am)           C
An angel will die
             Em
Covered in white
 
Closed eye
         G
And hoping for a better life
Am                         C
This time, we'll fade out tonight

[Intro]
D
 
[Verse 1]
D
   I got my first real six-string
A
   Bought it at the five-and-dime
D
   Played it 'til my fingers bled
A
   It was the summer of '69
 
[Verse 2]
D
   Me and some guys from school
A
   Had a band and we tried real hard
D
   Jimmy quit, Jody got married
A
   I shoulda known we'd never get far
 
[Chorus 1]
Bm             A
    Oh, when I look back now
D                         G
    That summer seemed to last forever
Bm           A
    And if I had the choice
D                    G
    Yeah, I'd always wanna be there
Bm                 A               D
    Those were the best days of my life
 
[Instrumental]
(D)   A
 
[Verse 3]
D
    Ain't no use in complainin'
A
    When you got a job to do
D
    Spent my evenin's down at the drive in
A
    And that's when I met you, yeah
 
[Chorus 2]
Bm                   A
    Standin' on your mama's porch
D                          G
    You told me that you'd wait forever
Bm                   A
    Oh, and when you held my hand
D                      G
    I knew that it was now or never
Bm                 A               D
    Those were the best days of my life
(D)            A                               D       A
         Oh yeah        Back in the summer of '69     Ohhh
 
[Bridge]
F               Bb
   Man, we were killin' time
        C
We were young and restless
   Bb/D
We needed to unwind
F          Bb                  C
   I guess nothin' can last forever, forever no
 
[Instrumental]
D    A    x2
 
[Verse 4]
D
   And now the times are changin'
A
   Look at everything that's come and gone
D
   Sometimes when I play that old six-string
A
   I think about you, wonder what went wrong
 
[Chorus 3]
Bm                   A
    Standin' on your mama's porch
D                         G
    You told me that it'd last forever
Bm                   A
    Oh, and when you held my hand
D                      G
    I knew that it was now or never
Bm                 A               D
    Those were the best days of my life
 
[Outro]
(D)            A                               D         A
         Oh yeah        Back in the summer of '69     Uh-huh
                      D         A
It was the summer of '69.    Oh yeah
                   D          A
Me and my baby in '69.       Ohhhhh, oh
D                   A                          D
         It was the summer, summer, summer of '69
  A      D      A      D      A
Yeah

  I got my driver’s license last week
                            Em
Just like we always talked about
 
'Cause you were so excited for me
                            C
To finally drive up to your house
 
But today I drove through the suburbs
                           G
Crying 'cause you weren't around
 
[Verse 2]
G
  And you're probably with that blonde girl
 
Who always made me doubt
Em
  She's so much older than me
 
She's everything I'm insecure about
        C
Yeah, today I drove through the suburbs
                                    G
'Cause how could I ever love someone else?

'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street
 
[Verse 3]
G
  And all my friends are tired
 
of hearing how much I miss you, but
Em
   I kinda feel sorry for them
 
'Cause they'll never know you the way that I do, yeah

Today I drove through the suburbs

[Verse 1]
          Am      C
I let it fall, my heart
           G                    Dm
And as it fell, you rose to claim it
        Am            C
It was dark and I was over
           G                     Dm
Until you kissed my lips and you saved me
    Am             C
My hands, they're strong
        G                  Dm
but my knees were far too weak
     Am           C
To stand in your arms 
         G               G
without falling to your feet

               F                 Dm
But there's a side to you that I never knew, never knew

All the things you'd say, they were never true, never true

And the games you'd play, you would always win, always win

But I set fire to the rain
            G                     G/A  G
Watched it pour as I touched your face

Well, it burned while I cried

When I lay with you

Sometimes I wake up by the door

That heart you caught must be waitin' for you

Dm             F           C                    G

You were an angel in the shape of my mum

When I fell down you’d be there
Am            F              C            G
Holding me up, spread your wings as you go 
          Am                F           C         G
And when God takes you back, he’ll say Hallelujah, you’re home

[Intro]
|Dsus4 D     |Bm  G     | (x2)
 
[Verse 1]
D
 I'm so glad you made the time to see me
Bm
 How's life, tell me how's your family
G                           D   A
 I haven't seen them in a while
D
 You've been good, busier than ever
Bm
 We small talk, work and the weather
G                              D  A
 Your guard is up, and I know why
 
[Pre-Chorus]
Bm                    A
 Because the last time you saw me
           D                          G
 Is still burned in the back of your mind
              Bm          A                  G
 You gave me roses and I left them there to die
 
[Chorus]
     D
So this is me swallowing my pride
             F#m
Standing in front of you saying
                     G
""I'm sorry for that night"" and I go
 D                A
Back to December all the time
    D
It turns out freedom ain't
 D
Nothing but missing you
F#m
Wishing I'd realized what I had
      G
When you were mine
 
[Post-Chorus]
        D
I'd go back to December,
 A                           G
Turn around and make it all right
     Bm               A
I go back to December all the time
 
[Instrumental]
|Dsus4 D     |Bm  G     | (x2)
 
[Verse 2]
D
 These days I haven't been sleeping
Bm
 Stayin' up playing back myself leaving
G                                        D  A
 When your birthday passed and I didn't call
         D
 Then I think about summer all the beautiful times
Bm
 I watch you laughing from the passenger side
    G                             D  A
 And realized I loved you in the fall
 
[Pre-Chorus]
Bm                     A
 And then the cold came the dark days
       D                  G
 When fear crept into my mind
             Bm
 You gave me all your love and
        A           G
 All I gave you was goodbye
 
[Chorus]
     D
So this is me swallowing my pride
             F#m
Standing in front of you saying
                     G
""I'm sorry for that night"" and I go
 D                A
Back to December all the time
   D
It turns out freedom ain't
 D
Nothing but missing you
F#m
Wishing I'd realized what I had
      G
When you were mine
 
[Post-Chorus]
        D
I'd go back to December,
 A                         G
Turn around and change my own mind
     Bm               A
I go back to December all the time
 
[Solo]
|D       |Bm G    | (x2)
 
[Bridge]
             Bm                G
I miss your tanned skin, your sweet smile
    D              A
So good to me, so right
             Bm              G
And how you held me in your arms
                D
That September night
                    A           Bm
The first time you ever saw me cry
                              G
Maybe this is wishful thinking
                          D
Probably mindless dreaming
 D                                       A
If you loved again I swear I'd love you right
 
       Bm                A               G
I'd go back in time and change it but I can't
           Bm               A           G
So if the chain is on your door I understand
 
[Interlude]
    D
But this is me swallowing my pride
            F#m
Standing in front of you saying
                    G
""I'm sorry for that night"" and I go
D              A
Back to December...
 
[Chorus]
    D
It turns out freedom ain't
 D
Nothing but missing you
F#m
Wishing I'd realized what I had
      G
When you were mine
        D
I'd go back to December
 A                           G
Turn around and make it all right
 
[Post-Chorus]
       Bm
I'd go back to December
 A                         G
Turn around and change my own mind
     Bm               A
I go back to December all the time

I hear the drums echoing tonight
B/F#              A/E           C#m         G#m  A  G#m C#m

I stopped an old man along the way

As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Ser - engeti

I seek to cure what's deep inside
G#m                A                 C#m
Frightened of this thing that I've become

*************************************************************************************
This is a great, sparse little folk song that emphasizes the bottom half of the
chords and strums mostly on the upbeats. The way this is done is by picking the bottom
two notes of the chord on the downbeats of the verses.
 
For example, with the F chord, it's played something like this, but the upper half of
the chord is strummed more than once in the rise and fall of the strumming hand:
 
e   1      1
B   1      1
G   2      2
D   3      3
A   3      3
E   x      x
 
The chorus is pretty much exactly like the intro.

C G Am F
 
[Verse 1]
  C                               G
I walked through the door with you, the air was cold
    Am                           F
But something 'bout it felt like home somehow, and I, 
C                           G
Left my scarf there at your sister's house
        Am                    F (once)
And you still got it, in your drawer, even now
 
[Interlude]
C G Am F
 
[Verse 2]
         C                        G
Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
      Am                          F
We're singing in the car, getting lost upstate
C                               G
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
      Am                   F
And I can picture it after all these days
 
[Pre-Chorus]
      C                             G
And I know it's long gone and, that magic's not here no more
      Am                       G            F   G   Am  F
And I might be okay but I'm not fine at all oh, oh, oh
 
[Chorus]
       C                          G
'Cause there we are again on that little town street
    Am                                 F
You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me
           C                      G                 Am   F
Wind in my hair, I was there, I remember it all too well
 
[Verse 3]
      C                          G
Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red
                 Am                           F
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-size bed
         C                                         G
And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the t-ball team
    Am                                    F
You tell me 'bout your past thinkin' your future was me
 
[Pre-Chorus]
      C                                 G
And I know it's long gone and there was nothing else I could do
         Am                              G                F G Am F
And I forget about you long enough to forget why I needed to
 
[Chorus]
       C                        G
'Cause here we are again in the middle of the night
      Am                                  F
We're dancing 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
         C                        G                 Am   F
Down the stairs, I was there, I remember it all too well
 
[Instrumental]
C G Am F G
 
[Bridge]
             C                            G
Maybe we got lost in translation, maybe I asked for too much
               Am                               F
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up
        C                        G                Am  F
Running scared, I was there, I remember it all too well
         C                        G
Hey, you call me up again just to break me like a promise
   Am                         F
So casually cruel in the name of being honest
          C                           G
I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lyin' here
                     Am         F
'Cause I remember it all, all, all too well
 
[Interlude]
C G Am F
 
[Verse 4]
C                            G
Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
            Am                           F
I'd like to be my old self again but I'm still tryin' to find it
      C                                    G
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
        Am                        F
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
        C                           G
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
            Am                            F
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
              C                      G                Am     F
You can't get rid of it 'cause you remember it all too well, yeah
 
[Chorus]
       C                         G
'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Am                                F
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
       C                      G                Am  F
It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well
           C                           G
Wind in my hair, you were there, you remember it all
         Am                            F
Down the stairs, you were there, you remember it all
       C                      G                Am   F
It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well

Although we both lie close together, we feel miles apart inside.

I listen to our favorite song, playing on the radio.
          G                                   Cadd9

 Come up to meet you, tell you I'm sorry

You don't know how lovely you are

I had to find you, tell you I need you
           C/B            Am7

Running in circles, coming up tails
           C/B
Heads on a science apart
 
[Chorus]
F                        C
  Nobody said it was easy

It's such a shame for us to part

 I was just guessing at numbers and figures
            C              Am7
Pulling the puzzles apart
             F                    C
Questions of science, science and progress
                C                 Am7
Do not speak as loud as my heart

C                G                 C              G
Round yon virgin mother and child, Holy infant so tender and mild

Sleep in heavenly peace, sleep in heavenly peace.

[Verse 1]
  E
I hear the train a-coming, it's rolling round the bend
                                   E7
and I ain't seen the sunshine since I don't know when
    A                                               E
I'm stuck in Folsom Prison, and time keeps draggin' on
         B7                                     E
But that train keeps a-rollin' on down to San Antone
 
 
[Verse 2]
     E
When I was just a baby, my Mama told me 'Son,
                            E7
always be a good boy; don't ever play with guns.'
      A                                     E
But I shot a man in Reno, just to watch him die
       B7                                           E
when I hear that whistle blowin' I hang my head and cry

[Verse 3]
  E
I bet there's rich folks eatin' in a fancy dining car
                                     E7
They're probably drinking coffee and smoking big cigars
        A                                       E
Well, I know I had it coming, I know I can't be free
          B7                                             E
But those people keep a moving, and that's what tortures me

[Verse 4]
              E
Well, if they freed me from this prison, if that railroad train was mine
                              E7
I bet I'd move it on a little farther down the line
A                                              E
Far from Folsom Prison, that's where I want to stay
        B7                                       E
And I'd let that lonesome whistle blow my blues away

Despacito
                               G
Quiero desnudarte a besos despacito
                                D
Firmo en las paredes de tu laberinto
                                   A
Y hacer de tu cuerpo todo un manuscrito
     A
Sube, sube, sube, sube, sube

Quiero ver bailar tu pelo

Quiero ser tu ritmo

Tus lugares favoritos (favorito, favorito baby)

Déjame sobrepasar tus zonas de peligro

Hasta provocar tus gritos

Despacito

Vamo' hacerlo en una playa en Puerto Rico
                                 D
Hasta que las olas griten ‘ay bendito'
                                  A
Para que mis hechos se queden contigo

There was something so pleasant about that place.
 
Even your emotions had an echo

In so much space
Am
And when you're out there, without care,
                     Cmaj7
Yeah, I was out of touch

(NOTES)
 
1) When a chord is followed by a !, it means that you do not strum the chord
but instead you play it in one quick downward motion.
2) When a chord is followed by a *, it means that the chord has to be plucked.
The plucking pattern is given below.
 
(PLUCKING PATTERN)
 
The plucking progression for Dm, Am and G goes like this
 
   Dm        Am        G
e|---1-----|---0-----|---------|
B|-----3---|-----1---|---3-0---|
G|-------2-|-------0-|-------0-|
D|-0-------|---------|---------|
A|---------|-0-------|---------|
E|---------|---------|-3-------|
 
Or this
 
   Dm        Am        G
e|---------|---------|---------|
B|---6-----|---5-----|---3-----|
G|-----7---|-----5---|-----4---|
D|-------7-|-------5-|-------5-|
A|-5-------|---------|---------|
E|---------|-5-------|-3-------|

But I wish there was somethin' you would do or say
   F                         D7
To try and make me change my mind and stay
C        G            Am             F
We never did too much talkin' anyway
C            G              C
Don't think twice, it's all right

No, it ain't no use in callin' out my name, gal
F                            C    G
  Like you never done before
       C               G              Am
And it ain't no use in callin' out my name, gal

   I can't hear you anymore

I'm a-thinkin' and a-wond'rin' walkin' down the road
  F                     D7
I once loved a woman, a child I am told
  C           G             Am            F
I gave her my heart but she wanted my soul
C           G                  C
Don't think twice, it's all right

[Verse 4]
   C   G            Am
So loooooong, honey babe
          F              C    G
Where I'm bound, I can't tell
    C         G          Am
But goodbye's too good a word, babe
D7                            G     G7
  So I'll just say fare thee well
C                          C7
I ain't sayin' you treated me unkind
    F                         D7
You could have done better but I don't mind
C              G        Am         F
You just kinda wasted my precious time
C           G               C

 I was down at the New Amsterdam  staring at this yellow-haired girl
    Am                       F                G
Mr. Jones strikes up a conversation with this black-haired flamenco dancer
         Am                    F              Dm                   G
You know she dances while his father plays guitar.  She's suddenly beautiful
   Am                 F         G
We all want something beautiful,  man, I wish I was beautiful
 
        Am                 F                        Dm

And pass me a bottle, Mr. Jones

  Believe in me.  Help me believe in anything

 Mr. Jones and me, tell each other fairy tales
    C                          F
and we stare at the beautiful women
       G                     G                        C
""She's looking at you.  Ah, no, no, she's looking at me.""

Smiling in the bright lights, coming through in stereo

When everybody loves you, you can never be lonely

      Am              F       Dm                G
Well, I will paint my picture.  Paint myself in blue and red and black and gray
Am                    F                    G
 All of the beautiful colors are very, very meaningful (yeah, well you know)
Am                   F       Dm           G
Gray is my favorite color  I-I felt so symbolic yesterday
Am           F             G
 If I knew Picasso I would buy myself a gray guitar and play

 Mr. Jones and me, look into the future

""She's looking at you.  Uh, I don't think so.  She's looking at me.""
C               F         G
Standing in the spotlight, I bought myself a gray guitar
     C           F       G                        Am

I want to be a lion.  Everybody wants to pass as cats
Am                                        G
We all want to be big, big stars, yeah but we got different reasons for that.
Am                       F
 Believe in me because I don't believe in anything
    Am                              G
And I want to be someone to believe, to believe, to believe.

 Mr. Jones and me, stumbling through the barrio

Yeah we stare at the beautiful women

""She's perfect for you, man, there's got to be somebody for me.""
C                  F
I want to be Bob Dylan
    G
Mr. Jones wishes he was someone just a little more funky
    C           F            G
When everybody loves you, ah son, that's just about as funky as you can be.
 
C    F            G
 Mr. Jones and me, staring at the video
       C               F                 G
When I look at the television, I want to see me staring right back at me.
C                 F                 G
We all want to be big stars, but we don't know why, and we don't know how.
         C               F                G
But when everybody loves me, I'm going to be just about as happy as I can be.
 
C   F            G
Mr. Jones and me, we're gonna be big stars.....

Cadd9                    G

when you said you needed space what?
 
Cadd9                          G
Then you come around again and say

baby I miss you and I swear I'm gonna change
         Cadd9                          G
Trust me remember how that lasted for a day

and me falling for it screaming that I'm right
              Cadd9                            G
And you would hide away and find your peace of mind

Cadd9     G          D       Em7
I used to think that we were forever ever

Cadd9            G               D                     Em7

Don't need make up

G                      B7 *
Sittin' in the mornin' sun
        C                        A
I'll be sittin' when the evenin' come
G                       B7
Watching the ships roll in
          C                    A
Then I'll watch 'em roll away again, yeah
 
[Chorus]
 
    G                          E
I'm sittin' on the dock of the bay
             G          E
Watching the tide roll away
              G                          A
Ooo, I'm just sittin' on the dock of the bay

Wastin' time
 
[Verse 2]
 
  G               B7
I left my home in Georgia
C                      A
Headed for the 'Frisco Bay
G                 B7
I have nothing to live for
          C                      A
Look like nothin's gonna come my way
 
[Chorus]
 
                  G                      E
So I'm just gonna sit on the dock of the bay
             G          E
Watching the tide roll away
         G                          A
Ooo, I'm sittin' on the dock of the bay
        G  E
Wastin' time
 
[Bridge]
 
G     D     C               G
 Look like, nothing's gonna change
G    D             C         G
Everything still remains the same
G       D       C          G
I can't do what ten people tell me to do
F                  D
 So I guess I'll remain the same, yes
 
[Verse 3]
 
G                       B7
Sittin' here resting my bones
         C                          A
And this loneliness won't leave me alone
     G                    B7
It's two thousand miles I roam
        C                 A
Just to make this dock my home
 
[Chorus]
 
                   G                      E
Now I'm just gonna sit at the dock of the bay
             G          E
Watching the tide roll away
         G                          A
Ooo, I'm sittin' on the dock of the bay

   G/F# [200033]
   D/F# [200233] - I've changed the D's in the chorus to D/F#'s
  Dsus4 [xx0233]   It's a very easy change from the Dsus4 to just
    Em7 [022033]      add that low E string for the D/F#.
 A7sus4 [x02033]    Thanks to UG member Delfius for the suggestion!

                    G    Em
There'll be no more aaaaaaaah!
            Bm
But you may feel a little sick
 
Bsus2         Bm
Can you stand up?
                  A
I do believe it's working, good
                 G                  Em
That'll keep you going through the show
     Bm
Come on, it's time to go
 
[Chorus]
D                           A
There is no pain, you are receding
D                             A
A distant ship smoke on the horizon
G/B C                              G
    You are only coming through in waves
G/B  C                                      G
    Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying
 
     D                         A
When I was a child, I caught a fleeting glimpse
D                       A
Out of the corner of my eye
G/B C                           G
    I turned to look but it was gone
                   G/B C
I cannot put my finger on it now
                        G
The child is grown, the dream is gone
 
Asus4   A  G/B  Cadd9    G                D
And  I           have become comfortably numb

I know your eyes in the morning sun
B7         Em7             F#7      G/A
I feel you touch me in the pouring rain

And now I'm tryin' to get back...

And bending over backwards just to try to see it clearer

But my breath fogged up the glass,
D
And so I drew a new face and I laughed
            A
I guess what I be saying is there ain't no better reason
      E
To rid yourself of vanity and just go with the seasons

It's what we aim to do
    D
Our name is our virtue

  I fell by the wayside, like everyone else
Bm
  I hate you, I hate you, I hate you, but I was just kidding myself

  Our every moment, I start to replace

  ‘cause now that they’re gone all I hear are the words that I needed to say

  When you hurt under the surface

Before you go

Was there something I coulda said to make your heart beat better?

If only I'd have known you had a storm to weather

It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless

Before you go
 
 
[Verse 2]
D
  Was never the right time, whenever you called
Bm
  Went little by little by little, until there was nothing at all
G
  Our every moment, I start to replay

Would we be better off by now?

If I'd let my walls come down?

Maybe I guess we’ll never know

You know, you know

[Verse 1]
                    A                          Dm
We passed upon the stair, we spoke of was and when
                   A                          F
Although I wasn't there, he said I was his friend
                   C                       A
Which came as a surprise, I spoke into his eyes
                     Dm                     C
I thought you died alone, a long long time ago
 
 
[Chorus 1]
            F
Oh no, not me
   C#             F
We never lost control
        C       F
You're face to face

I laughed and shook his hand, and made my way back home
                         A                            F
I searched for form and land, for years and years I roamed
                     C                        A
I gazed a gazeless stare, we walked a million hills
                   Dm                     C
I must have died alone, a long long time ago

G                          D/F#

[Verse 2]
G                               D/F#
  When evening shadows and the stars appear
F                              C

SPECIAL CHORD
Bbaug  x-1-4-3-3-x  or  6-5-4-3-3-x
 
Tip for beginners:
The Bbaug in the chorus might be substituted by a Daug  x-x-0-3-3-2
which is much easier to play.

[Verse 1]
 
   D
If you, if you could return
             A6
Don't let it burn, don't let it fade
                    Cadd9
I'm sure I might be rude
 
But it's just your attitude
                 G
It's tearing me apart
 
It's ruining everything
      D
And I swore, I swore I would be true
                  A6
And honey, so did you
                            Cadd9
So why were you holding her hand
 
Is that the way we stand
                       G
Were you lying all the time
 
Was it just a game to you
 
 
[Chorus]
 
              D
But I'm in so deep
                    A6
You know I'm such a fool for you
                               Cadd9
You got me wrapped around your finger
                      G
Do you have to let it linger
 
Do you have to, do you have to
                      D
Do you have to let it linger
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
      A6
Oh, I thought the world of you
          Cadd9
I thought nothing could go wrong
          G
But I was wrong, I was wrong
   D
If you, if you could get by
              A6
Trying not to lie
                         Cadd9
Things wouldn't be so confused
 
And I wouldn't feel so used
                      G
But you always really knew
 
I just wanna be with you
 
 
[Chorus]
 
              D
And I'm in so deep
                    A6
You know I'm such a fool for you
                               Cadd9
You got me wrapped around your finger
                      G
Do you have to let it linger
 
Do you have to, do you have to
                      D
Do you have to let it linger
 
 
(Instrumental)
 
 
[Chorus]
              D

                               Cadd9
You got me wrapped around your finger
                      G
Do you have to let it linger
 
Do you have to, do you have to

Do you have to let it linger

[Verse 1]
 
Am                G
  Beauty queen of only eighteen
  Am                 G
She had some trouble with herself
Am              G
  He was always there to help her
   Am                  G
She always belonged to someone else
 
Am            G
  I drove for miles and miles
    Am               G
And wound up at your door
Am             G                 Am
  I’ve had you so many times but somehow
       G
I want more
 
 
[Chorus]
 
C                       G
  I don’t mind spending everyday
Am                          G
  Out on your corner in the pouring rain
C                            G
  Look for the girl with the broken smile
Am                        F
  Ask her if she wants to stay awhile
        C       G
And she will be loved
        Am      F
And she will be loved
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
Am                 G
  Tap on my window knock on my door
 Am                     G
I want to make you feel beautiful
Am                 G
  I know I tend to get so insecure
Am                  G
  It doesn’t matter anymore
 
Am                G
  It’s not always rainbows and butterflies
     Am                        G
It’s compromise that moves us along, yeah
Am                        G
  My heart is full and my door’s always open
        Am               G
You can come anytime you want

She will be loved

And she will be loved

And she will be loved
 
 
[Bridge]
 
Am                 G
  I know where you hide 
              Am
Alone in your car
                G                              Am
Know all of the things that make you who you are
                G                    Am
I know that goodbye means nothing at all
                       G                       F
Comes back and begs me catch her every time she falls... yeah

Do you need some time all alone?
          F                        G
Everybody needs some time on their own
                   F                   G
Don't you know you need some time all alone
 
[Bridge]
Em             F               C
   I know it's hard to keep an open heart
Em           F                   Dm
   When even friends seem out to harm you
Em         F               C
   But if you could heal a broken heart
Em          F              G
   Wouldn't time be out to charm you

[Chorus]
            F                    G
Sometimes I need some time on my own
            F                   G
Sometimes I need some time all alone
          F                        G
Everybody needs some time on their own
                   F                   G
Don't you know you need some time all alone
 
[Solo 2]
| F  | Dm | C  | C  | (x2)
 
[Verse 3]
F                        Dm
  And when your fears subside
                    C
And shadows still remain, oh yeah
F                     Dm
  I know that you can love me
                            C
When there's no one left to blame
Dm                   G
   So never mind the darkness
                    C
We still can find a way
Dm                        G
  'Cause nothin' lasts forever
                   (C)
Even cold November rain

   Don't you you think that you need somebody

  Don't you think that you need someone
Ab           Bb            C5
   Everybody needs somebody. You're not the only one.  You're not the only one.

[Verse 1]
          Em            G   C   B
I'm gonna fight 'em off
               Em            G       C    B
A seven nation army couldn't hold me back
              Em         G   C   B
They're gonna rip it off
             Em           G       C    B
Taking their time right behind my back
        Em           G       C
And I'm talking to myself at night
          B        Em   G   C   B
Because I can't forget
Em             G          C
Back and forth through my mind
         B   Em    G   C   B
Behind a cigarette
      G                      A
And a message coming from my eyes says leave it alone

[Verse 2]
            Em            G   C   B
Don't wanna hear about it
               Em            G       C   B
Every single one's got a story to tell
          Em            G   C   B
Everyone knows about it
               Em            G       C    B
From the Queen of England to the hounds of Hell
          Em            G  C  B
And if I catch it coming back my way
               Em         G   C   B
I'm gonna serve it to you
          Em            G  C  B
And that ain't what you want to hear
               Em       G   C   B
But that's what I'll do
      G                      A
And a feeling coming from my bones says find a home

[Verse 3]
             Em      G   C   B
I'm goin' to Wichita
              Em        G     C   B
Far from this opera, forever more
          Em             G   C   B
I'm gonna work the straw
               Em          G       C   B
Make the sweat drip out of every pore
        Em               G                C
And I'm bleeding and I'm bleeding and I'm bleeding
        B         Em   G   C   B
Right before the Lord
        Em              G            C
All the words are gonna bleed from me
           B        Em   G   C   B
And I will sing no more
        G                     A
And the stains coming from my blood tell me go back home

G5         G5/F#                G5/E         G5/D
Summer has come and passed, the innocent can never last
C          Cm             G5          G5
Wake me up when September ends
G5         G5/F#               G5/E            G5/D

[Intro]*
 
A
 
[Verse]
 
A              F#m
Almost heaven, West Virginia,
E                     D          A
Blue Ridge Mountains, Shenandoah River.
                   F#m
Life is old there, older than the trees,
E                           D              A
Younger than the mountains, growin' like a breeze.
 
[Chorus]
 
A                      E
Country roads, take me home,
       F#m       D
To the place I belong: 
     A                  E
West Virginia, mountain momma,
        D             A
Take me home, country roads.
 
[Verse]
 
A                F#m
All my mem'ries, gather 'round her,
E             D                A
Miner's lady, stranger to blue water.
                F#m
Dark and dusty, painted on the sky,
E                         D              A
Misty taste of moonshine, teardrop in my eye.
 
[Chorus]
 
A                      E
Country roads, take me home,
       F#m       D
To the place I belong:
     A                  E
West Virginia, mountain momma,
        D             A
Take me home, country roads.
 
[Bridge]
 
F#m        E             A
I hear her voice, in the mornin' hours she calls me,
    D       A              E
The radio reminds me of my home far away.
    F#m              G
And drivin' down the road,
        D              A                     E
I get a feelin' that I should have been home yesterday,
      E7
yesterday.
 
[Chorus]
 
        A              E
Country roads, take me home,
       F#m       D
To the place I belong:
     A                  E
West Virginia, mountain momma,
        D             A
take me home, country roads.
 
        A              E
Country roads, take me home,
       F#m       D
To the place I belong:
     A                  E
West Virginia, mountain momma,
        D             A
take me home, country roads.
 
[Outro]
 
        E             A
Take me home, country roads.
        E                  A
Take me home, down country roads.

Tabbed by: Krista

Tuning: Standard
 
There's more than one way you could play this,
I'm not sure how Taylor plays it because she mutes it a bit,
so you don't really hear the high strings.

      D                      Em                 G                 A
I was riding shotgun with my hair undone in the front seat of his car
           D                  Em
He’s got a one-hand feel on the steering wheel
    G          A
The other on my heart
D                       Em
I look around, turn the radio down
        G                 A
He says baby is something wrong?
  D                 Em                G               A
I say nothing I was just thinking how we don’t have a song
 
And he says...
 
[Chorus]
D               Em
Our song is the slamming screen door,
G                          A
Sneakin’ out late, tapping on your window
D                  Em                 G
When we’re on the phone and you talk real slow
           A                        D
Cause it’s late and your mama don’t know
                Em
Our song is the way you laugh
    G                         A
The first date “man, I didn’t kiss her, but I should have”
Em             A                       Em
And when I got home ... before I said amen
          D   G
Asking God if he could play it again

[Verse 2]
D                    Em                      G          A
I was walking up the front porch steps after everything that day
    D                      Em
Had gone all wrong or been trampled on
    G                A
And lost and thrown away
D                   Em             G            A
Got to the hallway, well on my way to my lovin’ bed
  D                    Em
I almost didn’t notice all the roses
G                A
And the note that said...
 
[Chorus]
D               Em
Our song is the slamming screen door,
G                          A
Sneakin’ out late, tapping on your window

I’ve heard every album, listened to the radio
D          A            Em
Waited for something to come along
            G
That was as good as our song

And when I got home ... before I said amen

Play it again... Ho yea ho yea

In the front seat of his car
D                      Em
I grabbed a pen and an old napkin
      G
And I... wrote down our song

    She lives with a broken man
                 E      D
A cracked polystyrene man
          A           D
Who just crumbles and burns
A                        F#m7
    He used to do surgery
                   E   D
For girls in the eighties
            A     D
But gravity always wins
 
 
[Chorus]
 
                 Bm
And it wears him out..
             A
It wears him out..
             Bm
It wears him out..
      Asus4     A
It weeeeeaaaars
 
 
[Verse 3]
 
A                                F#m7
    She looks like the real thing
                      E    D
She tastes like the real thing
          A     D
My fake plastic love
A                               F#m7
    But I can't help the feeling
                          E   D
I could blow through the ceiling
         A         D
If I just turn and run
 
 
[Chorus]
 
                Bm7
And it wears me out
            A
It wears me out
            Bm7
It wears me out
            A
It wears me out
 
 
[Outro]
 
               Bm7
And if I could be who you wanted
           A
If I could be who you wanted
     Bm7
All the time..
     A
All the time..

There's a calm surrender

[Verse 1]
 
Em                    G
There was a time when I was alone
C                    G
Nowhere to go and no place to call home
Em                      G
My only friend was the man in the moon
    C                        G
And even sometimes he would go away too
Em                 G
Then one night as I closed my eyes
C              G
I saw a shadow flyin' high
Em                     G
He came to me with the sweetest smile
C                     G
Told me he wanted to talk for a while
        Em             G
He said,   ""Peter Pan, that's what they call me.
C                       G
  I promise that you'll never be lonely.""
    Am               D     *
And ever since that day
 
 
[Chorus]
 
Em                 G
   I am a lost boy,  from Neverland
C                        G
Usually hangin' out with   Peter Pan
Em                         G
   And when we're bored we play in the woods
C                      G
Always on the run from   Captain Hook
Em         G       C              G
""Run, run, lost boy"", they say to me
 Em       G      C      G
Away from all of   reality
Em                   G
Neverland is home to lost boys like me
    C                     G
And lost boys like me are free
 
Em                   G
Neverland is home to lost boys like me
    C                     G
And lost boys like me are free
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
   Em                             G
He sprinkled me in pixie dust and told me to believe
  C                   G
Believe in him, and believe in me
  Em                      G
Together we will fly away in a cloud of green
C                 G
To your beautiful destiny
      Em                         G
As we soared above the town that never loved me
  C                        G
I realized I finally had a family
Em                     G
Soon enough we reached Neverland
C                  G
Peacefully my feet hit the sand
    Am               D     *
And ever since that day

I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet, to go over everything

I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet.

      Bb                  F
Can't help but wish that I was there
      C
Back where I'd love to be, oh yeah
 
[Chorus]
F    C       Dm          C
Dear God the only thing I ask of you is
    Bb                      F
to hold her when I'm not around,
          C
when I'm much too far away
F        C         Dm           C
We all need that person who can be true to you
       Bb               F
But I left her when I found her
    C
And now I wish I'd stayed
            Bb             C
’Cause I'm lonely and I'm tired
      A7          Dm  C  Bb
I'm missing you again oh no
           F
Once again
 
[Verse 2]
F                C          Dm              Am
There's nothing here for me on this barren road
        Bb                         F
There's no one here while the city sleeps
      C
and all the shops are closed
F               C            Dm                 Am
Can't help but think of the times I've had with you
Bb                 F              C
Pictures and some memories will have to help me through, oh yeah
 
[Chorus]
F    C        Dm           C
Dear God the only thing I ask of you is
     Bb                        F
to hold her when I'm not around,
          C
when I'm much too far away

I'm missing you again oh no
          F
Once again
 
[Bridge]
Dm     A7     Bb               F
Some search, never finding a way
Dm      A7  Bb             F
Before long, they waste away
Dm      A7  Bb                      F
I found you, something told me to stay
Dm    A7  Bb               F
I gave in, to selfish ways
Gm                         C
And how I miss someone to hold
 
when hope begins to fade...
 
F         C             Dm                 Am
A lonely road, crossed another cold state line
Bb               F            C
Miles away from those I love purpose hard to find
 
[Chorus]
F     C      Dm            C
Dear God the only thing I ask of you is

when I'm much too far away

I'm missing you again oh no

[Intro]
 
C G F C  F C D7 G  C G F C  F G C   G
 
[Verse 1]
 
     C      G          F    C
It's nine o'clock on a Saturday
    F       C              D7  G
The regular crowd shuffles in
           C       G       F       C
There's an old man sitting next to me
       F           G         C   G
Making love to his tonic and gin
 
          C            G         F   C
He says, ""Son, can you play me a memory
    F          C           D7   G
I'm not really sure how it goes
         C            G           F          C
But it's sad and it's sweet and I knew it complete
     F        G             C
When I wore a younger man's clothes.""
 
[Interlude]
 
Am              D7

Am           D7    G  F C G7

[Chorus]
 
C         G                F     C
Sing us a song, you're the piano man
F         C      D7   G
Sing us a song tonight
            C          G          F   C
Well, we're all in the mood for a melody
    F                 G         C     G
And you've got us all feeling alright
 
[Verse 2]
 
    C           G        F         C
Now John at the bar is a friend of mine
   F          C          D7  G
He gets me my drinks for free
         C            G              F             C
And he's quick with a joke and he'll light up your smoke
            F               G           C   G
But there's some place that he'd rather be
 
          C         G             F       C
He says, ""Bill, I believe this is killing me.""
       F          C            D7  G
As the smile ran away from his face
          C           G          F     C
""Well I'm sure that I could be a movie star
   F           G           C
If I could get out of this place""

[Verse 3]
 
    C         G           F   C
Now Paul is a real estate novelist
    F         C          D7  G
Who never had time for a wife
         C            G           F            C
And he's talking with Davy, who's still in the Navy
    F             G      C   G
And probably will be for life
 
        C           G          F   C
And the waitress is practicing politics
       F           C           D7    G
As the businessman slowly gets stoned
             C         G               F     C
Yes, they're sharing a drink they call loneliness
         F           G         C    G
But it's better than drinking alone
 
[Chorus]
 
C         G                F     C
Sing us a song, you're the piano man
F         C      D7   G
Sing us a song tonight
            C          G          F   C
Well, we're all in the mood for a melody
    F                 G         C     G
And you've got us all feeling alright
 
[Verse 4]
 
       C           G           F    C
It's a pretty good crowd for a Saturday
        F       C          D7    G
And the manager gives me a smile
          C               G               F         C
'Cause he knows that it's me they've been coming to see
   F            G           C   G
To forget about life for a while
 
        C         G             F    C
And the piano, it sounds like a carnival
        F          C             D7  G
And the microphone smells like a beer
         C          G           F           C
And they sit at the bar and put bread in my jar
          F             G         C     G
And say, ""Man, what are you doing here?""
 
[Interlude]
 
Am              D7

Am           D7    G  F C G7

From 'Back to Bedlam'
 
A rare tab from Worzell - (Actually my only tab - frustrated at not being able to find
it anywhere on the internet, I actually bothered to write it down - good song).There's
two Guitars - Both have a Capo on the 3rd Fret, everything written relative to capo:
 
Hammer on & Pull off twice on each chord of the verse:
C  (hammer on & pull off on the D string)
G  (hammer on & pull off on the A string)
Am (hammer on & pull off on the D string)
F  (hammer on & pull off on the G string)

My life is brilliant.

My love is pure.

I saw an angel,

Of that I'm sure.
C
She smiled at me on the subway.
        G
She was with another man.
    Am
But I won't lose no sleep on that,
 F
'Cause I've got a plan.

Yeah, she caught my eye,

As we walked on by.

She could see from my face that I was,

Fucking high.

And I don't think that I'll see her again,

But we shared a moment that will last till the end.

When she thought up that I should be with you.

I will never be   with you.

[Verse]
C          G/B                Am7  G/B
 I took my love and I took it down
C            G/B                    Am7   G/B
 I climbed a mountain and I turned around
      C        G/B             Am7          G/B
And I saw my reflection in the snow covered hills
         C         G/B        Am7
Till the landslide brought me down
 
[Verse]
G/B C             G/B         Am7   G/B
Oh, mirror in the sky what is love
        C               G/B         Am7   G/B
Can the child within my heart rise above
      C                G/B      Am7   G/B
Can I sail through the changing ocean tides
      C          G/B     Am7   G/B  C   G/B   Am7  G/B
Can I handle the seasons of my li-i-i-i-i-i-i-ife
 
[Pre-Chorus]

   Mmm...
 
[Chorus]
      G          D7/F#    Em
Well, I've been afraid of changing cause I
C        G/B         Am     D/F#
Built my life around you
    G              D7/F#        Em
But time makes you bolder, even children get older

And I'm getting older too

Built my life around you

Oh, I'm getting older too
 
[Verse]
    C           G/B           Am7   G/B
Ah, ah, take my love, take it down
    C           G/B                 Am7   G/B
Ah, ah, climb a mountain and turn around
           C          G/B           Am7          G/B
And if you see my reflection in the snow covered hills
         C         G/B       Am7   G/B
Will the landslide bring you down?
           C        G/B             Am7          G/B
And if you see my reflection in the snow covered hills...

Will the landslide bring you down?
 G/B        C         G/B        Am7

[Verse 1]
F                    Am                 G
You gotta go and get angry at all of my honesty
F                    Am                      G
You know I try but I don't do too well with apologies
F                         Am                       G
I hope I don't run out of time, can someone call a referee?
             F             Am         G
Cause I just need one more shot at forgiveness
F                      Am                        G
I know you know that I made those mistakes maybe once or twice
F                       Am             G
By once or twice I mean maybe a couple hundred times
   F                 Am                G
So let me, oh let me redeem, oh redeem myself tonight
             F             Am             G
Cause I just need one more shot at second chances
 
[Pre-Chorus]
F       Am                  G
  Is it too late now to say sorry?
         F           Am               G
Cause I'm missing more than just your body
F       Am                  G

       Dm
Yeah I know that I let you down

    F                         Am                   G
But you know that there is no innocent one in this game for two
F                    Am                    G
I go, I go and then you go, you go out and spill the truth
       F            Am            G
Can we both say the words, say forget this?

  Is it too late now to say sorry?

Cause I'm missing more than just your body

Dm  F  C  Gm
 
 
[Verse 1]
 
          Dm       F
I let it fall, my heart,
          C                Gm
And as it fell you rose to claim it.
       Dm                 F
It was dark and I was over,
          C                       Csus4
Until you kissed my lips and you saved me
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
          Dm       F
My hands they're strong,
          C                Gm
but my knees were far too weak,
          Dm       F
Stand in your arms
          C             Csus4
without falling to your feet,
 
 
[Pre-chorus]
 
              Bb                   Gm
But there's a side to you that I never knew, I never knew.
           Dm                                 Dm
All the things you'd say, they were never true, never true,
          Bb                     C
And the games you'd play, you would always, always win.
 
 
[Chorus]
 
           Dm
But I set fire to the rain,
         C
Watch it pour as I touched your face,
         Gm
Well, it burned while I cried,
                                   Dm          C
Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name
 
 
[Verse 3]
 
       Dm       F
When I lay with you
          C         Gm
I could stay there, close my eyes
         Dm      F
Feel you here forever,
        C                       Csus4
You and me together, nothing is better
 
 
[Pre-chorus]

But there's a side to you that I never knew, I never knew.

But I set fire to the rain,

Well, it burned while I cried,
                                    Dm         C
Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name
      Dm
I set fire to the rain
      C
And I threw us into the flames
        Gm
Where I felt something die,
                                    Bb             C
Cause I knew that that was the last time, the last time
 
 
[Bridge]
 
         Bb                F/A
Sometimes I wake up by the door,
              Am                          C
That heart you caught, must be waiting for you,
     Bb                      F/A
Even now when we're already over,
         Am                          C
I can't help myself from looking for you
 
 
[Chorus]
 
      Dm
I set fire to the rain,
         C
Watch it pour as I touch your face,
         Gm
Well, it burned when I cried,
                               Dm          C
Cause I heard it screaming your name, your name
      Dm
I set fire to the rain,
      C
And I threw us into the flames

Where I felt something die,
                               Bb             C
Cause I knew that was the last time, the last time, oh, oh

Let it burn!

If you wanna play like the piano, transpose this tab 5 steps down
and put a capo on the 5th fret and play the intro and the verse like this:

you twist to fit the mold that I am in

  Back and forth, we sway like branches in a storm

[Verse 1]
Em              Am  Em                       Am  G
 My lover's got humor, she's the giggle at a funeral
                         Am  Em                            Am  Em
Knows everybody's disapproval, I should've worshipped her sooner
                    Am       Em                     Am       G
If the Heavens ever did speak, she’s the last true mouthpiece
                        Am      Em                 Am      D
Every Sunday's getting more bleak, a fresh poison each week
                  C
We were born sick, you heard them say it
Em                   Am      Em                              Am      G
 My church offers no absolutes, she tells me 'worship in the bedroom'
                        Am    Em                   Am     D
The only heaven I'll be sent to is when I'm alone with you
               C
I was born sick, but I love it. Command me to be well

Song: Sign of the Times
Key: F major
Tempo: 60 BPM
Tuning: E Standard
Capo: None or 5th fret (transpose down 5)
 
Tabbed by: Matty Sievers

Such an amazing song yet so simple!
 
From the start to the bridge (4:01) it's F for 1 bar, Dm for 1 bar and then C for 2 bars.
Then from there, the bridge is F, Dm, C and Bb for 1 bar each until 4:49 then it goes back to
the normal progression for four bars but on those last four, you use the bridge chords.
So rather than C for two bars before the end on F, it's C and Bb for one bar each.
 
This will all be in the chords below though; just giving you a basic outline before diving in.
I'm playing this with no capo as it's fairly easy but if you aren't keen on the Dm or the Bb
you can transpose this down by 5, put your capo on 5th and have a fun time playing in the basic
C fingering postions. That is probably best if you're gonna solo this as an acoustic singer and
need to focus on scrunching your face up when you sing. :P
 
Edit: Lyrics have been fixed.
 
Edit #2: Upon closer inspection and a few more sit downs at the piano and the guitar there is most
certainly a C7 chord in there and have added it in. However, it also sounds fairly good without it so do
what you are comfortable with.

  Our dreams, and they are made out of real things
       F           C/E
Like a shoe box of photographs
     Dm          G
With sepia-toned loving
C             C/B
  Love is the answer
             Am                       Am/G
At least for most of the questions in my heart like
F            C/E                   Dm
  Why are we here? And where do we go?
                  G
And how come it's so hard?
C                 C/B
  It's not always easy and
          Am            Am/G
Sometimes life can be deceiving
F                   C/E                Dm                  G
  I'll tell you one thing, it's always better when we're together
 
[Chorus]
F                   G                           (F# - F)
  Mmmm, it's always better when we're together
F                         G                           (F# - F)
  Yeah, we'll look at the stars and we're together
F                   G                           (F# - F)
  Well, it's always better when we're together
F                   G                           (F# - F)

And all of these moments
           C/B                     Am           Am/G
Just might find their way into my dreams tonight,
      F                    C/E
But I know that they’ll be gone
         Dm            G
When the morning light sings
           C          C/B
And brings new things
      Am               Am/G
For tomorrow night you see
     F               C/E
That they’ll be gone too,
         Dm               G
Too many things I have to do
                    C                 C/B
But if all of these dreams might find their way
        Am             Am/G
Into my day to day scene
       F            C/E
I'd be under the impression
      Dm              G
I was somewhere in between
          C
With only two,
            C/B
Just me and you,
            Am               Am/G
Not so many things we got to do
   F                C/E
Or places we got to be
            Dm              G
We'll sit beneath the mango tree, now

F                       G                           (F# - F)

F                   G                           (F# - F)
  Well, it's always better when we're together
F                   G                           (F# - F)
  Yeah, it's always better when we're together

[Instrumental]

[Bridge]
Dm                     G
  I believe in memories they look so
Dm                      G
  So pretty when I sleep hey now and
Dm         G
  When I wake up you look so
  Dm                      G
  Pretty sleeping next to me but there is
F                G
  Not enough time there is no
F                     G
  No song I could sing and there is no
Dm/F                  G
  Combination of words I could say
           Dm/F                     G
But I will still tell you one thing
We're better together

C
  Hey there Delilah,
          Em
What’s it like in New York City? 
      C
I’m a thousand miles away, 
           Em
But girl tonight you look so pretty, 
        Am   G
Yes you do, 
F                   G                  Am
  Time Square can’t shine as bright as you, 
             G
I swear it’s true. 
C
  Hey there Delilah, 
          Em
Don’t you worry about the distance, 
          C
I’m right there if you get lonely, 
          Em
Give this song another listen, 
           Am     G
Close your eyes, 
F              G                Am
  Listen to my voice it’s my disguise, 
            G
I’m by your side. 
 
[Chorus]
C                      Am
Oh it’s what you do to me, 
C                      Am
Oh it’s what you do to me, 
C                      Am
Oh it’s what you do to me, 
C                      Am
Oh it’s what you do to me, 
               C
What you do to me.
 
[Verse]
C
  Hey there Delilah,
       Em
I know times are getting hard, 
           C
But just believe me girl some day, 
             Em
I'll pay the bills with this guitar, 
              Am     G
We'll have it good, 
F                G               Am
  We'll have the life we knew we would, 
           G
My word is good.
 
C
  Hey there Delilah, 
         Em
I’ve got so much left to say, 
         C
If every simple song I wrote to you, 
      Em
Would take your breath away, 
             Am    G
I’d write it all, 
F              G                  Am
  Even more in love with me you’d fall, 
             G
We’d have it all.
 
[Chorus]
C                      Am
Oh it’s what you do to me, 
C                      Am
Oh it’s what you do to me,

Oh it’s what you do to me,

Oh it’s what you do to me, 
 
[Bridge]
  F
A thousand miles seems pretty far, 
    G
But they’ve got planes and trains and cars, 
    C                             Am
I’d walk to you if I had no other way, 
    F
Our friends would all make fun of us, 
    G
And we'll just laugh along because, 
   C                                     Am
We know that none of them have felt this way, 
  F
Delilah I can promise you, 
     G
That by the time that we get through, 
    Am
The world will never ever be the same,
              G
And you’re to blame.
 
[Verse]
C                          Em
  Hey there Delilah you be good, And don’t you miss me, 
         C
Two more years and you’ll be done with school, 
    Em
And I'll be making history, 
       Am   G
Like I do, 
F                  G              Am
  You’ll know it's all because of you, 
F               G            Am
  We can do whatever we want to,
F             G               Am
  Hey there Delilah here's to you, 
               G
This one’s for you.
 
[Chorus]
C                      Am
Oh it’s what you do to me,
C                      Am
Oh it’s what you do to me,
C                      Am
Oh it’s what you do to me,

[Verse 1]
Csus2                    Am
  There is freedom within,  there is freedom without
F                                    E     Asus2/E
  Try to catch the deluge in a paper cup
Csus2                    Am
  There's a battle ahead,   many battles are lost
F
  But you'll never see the end of the road
             E
while you're travelling with me
 
[Chorus]
F        G              C          Am
Hey now, hey now, don't dream it's over
F        G                 C           Am
Hey now, hey now, when the world comes in
F          G         C                    Am
They come, they come   to build a wall between us
F                        F   G
  We know they won't win
 
[Verse 2]
Csus2                  Am
  Now I'm towing my car,  there's a hole in the roof
F                                             E                 Asus2/E
  My possessions are causing me suspicion but there's no proof
Csus2               Am
  In the paper today,  tales of war and of waste
F                                   E
  But you turn right over to the TV page
 
[Chorus]
F        G              C          Am
Hey now, hey now, don't dream it's over
F        G                 C           Am
Hey now, hey now, when the world comes in
F          G         C                    Am
They come, they come   to build a wall between us
F             F         F
  We know they won't win
 
[Instrumental]
Csus2    Am    F    E
Csus2    Am    F    E
F  C  F  C  F  C  Bb    Bb
 
[Verse 3]
Csus2                  Am
  Now I'm walking again,  to the beat of the drum
F                                                E      Asus2/E
  And I'm counting the steps to the door of your heart
Csus2               Am
  Only shadows ahead,  barely clearing the roof
F                                      E
 Get to know the feeling of liberation and release
 
[Chorus]
F/D      G/E            C          Am
Hey now, hey now, don't dream it's over
F        G                 C           Am
Hey now, hey now, when the world comes in
F          G         C                    Am
They come, they come   to build a wall between us
F             F         F
  We know they won't win
 
[Outro]
F  G  C  Am
(repeat)
Don't let them win
Hey now, hey now

                E
The dark of the alley
                 E
The break of the day
                 C#m
Head while I'm driving
      C#m
I'm driving
 
              E
Soft lips are open
                  E
Them knuckles are pale

          E
Hot as a fever
          E
Rattling bones
              C#m
I could just taste it
 C#m
Taste it
 
               E
If it's not forever
               E
If it's just tonight
                      C#m
Oh, we're still the greatest
      Amaj7
The greatest, the greatest

                     C#m    A
With what's to transpire
 
    E
And you
                C#m    A
Your sex is on fire
 
    E
Consumed
                     C#m    A    E

          Dm                       C              Bb       A
You get a shiver in the dark, it's raining in the park but meantime
Dm                        C            Bb         A
  South of the river you stop and you hold everything
F                                 C
  A band is blowing Dixie double four time
Bb                                            Dm    Bb - C

Dm                      C                Bb      A
   Coming in out of the rain to hear the jazz go down
F                       C
  Competition in other places
Bb                                     Dm
   Uh, but the horns they blowin' that sound

You check out Guitar George,     he knows all the chords
Dm                             C               Bb          A
  Mind he's strictly rhythm he doesn't want to make it cry or sing
F                           C
  They say an old guitar is all he can afford
Bb                                                 Dm    Bb - C
   When he gets up under the lights to play his thing

   And Harry doesn't mind if he doesn't make the scene
Dm                   C         Bb      A
  He's got a daytime job, he's doin' alright
F                                  C
  He can play the honky tonk like anything
Bb                               Dm    Bb - C
   Saving it up for Friday night

[Verse 5]
       Dm                           C        Bb           A
Then a crowd of young boys, they're foolin' around in the corner
Dm                                C              Bb            A
   Drunk and dressed in their best brown baggies and their platform soles
F                                        C
  They don't give a damn about about any trumpet playin' band
Bb                                   Dm     Bb - C
   It ain't what they call rock and roll
                Bb - C
and the Sultans
                             Dm

[Verse 6]
Dm                       C         Bb         A
   And then the man he steps right up to the microphone
Dm              C               Bb        A    (A7)
   And says at last just as the time bell ring
F                      C
  Goodnight, now it's time to go home
Bb                                       Dm     Bb - C
   Then he makes it fast with one more thing
                   Bb - C
We are the Sultans

[Verse 1]
D
I can almost see it
 
That dream I’m dreaming but
G
There’s a voice inside my head saying
Em
You’ll never reach it
D
Every step I’m taking,
 
Every move I make feels
G
Lost with no direction
Em
My faith is shaking but
Bm              F#m
I, I gotta keep trying
       G                 Em
Gotta keep my head held high
 
[Chorus]
D
There’s always gonna be another mountain
 
I’m always gonna wanna make it move
G
Always gonna be an uphill battle
Em                  A
Sometimes I’m gonna have to lose
D
It ain’t about how fast I get there
                                         Bm  A  G
Ain’t about what’s waiting on the other side
           D
It’s the climb
 
[Verse 2]
D
The struggles I’m facing,
 
The chances I’m taking
G
Sometimes might knock me down but
Em
No, I’m not breaking
D
I may not know it,
 
But these are the moments that
G
I’m gonna remember most, yeah
Em
Just gotta keep going
    Bm
And I,
            F#m
I gotta be strong
G                 Em
Just keep pushing on

D
There’s always gonna be another mountain
 
I’m always gonna wanna make it move

Sometimes I’m gonna have to lose

There’s always gonna be another mountain
 
I’m always gonna wanna make it move

Always gonna be an uphill battle

  Somebody gonna have to lose
D
Ain’t about how fast I get there

It’s the climb
 
[Outro]
         D
Keep on moving, keep climbing, keep the faith, baby
G                                     D
  It’s all about, it’s all about the climb

             G          Am
Make 'em go ""Oh, oh, oh"" 
                        Em              C
You're gonna leave 'em all in awe, awe, awe
 
[Verse 2]
G                     Am
You don't have to feel like a waste of space 
Em             C
You're original, cannot be replaced 
G               Am
If you only knew what the future holds 
Em                      C
After a hurricane comes a rainbow 
 
G                     Am
Maybe your reason why all the doors are closed 
Em                       C
So you could open one that leads you to the perfect road 
G                     Am
Like a lightning bolt, your heart will blow 
Em
And when it's time, you'll know 
C
You just gotta
 
[Pre-Chorus]
G          Am          Em     C
Ignite, the light, and let it shine 
     G       Am             Em        C
Just own the night like the 4th of July 
 
[Chorus]
                      G    Am
'Cause baby you're a firework
                   Em           C
Come on, show 'em what you're worth 
             G          Am
Make 'em go ""Oh, oh, oh"" 
                        Em    C
As you shoot across the sky-y-y

Baby, you're a firework

Boom, boom, boom

See the light as it shines on the sea? It's blinding
           Am                 F
But no one knows, how deep it goes
       C                                             G
And it seems like it's calling out to me, so come find me
           Am             F
And let me know, what's beyond that line, will I cross that line?
 
[Chorus 3]
         Db                                     Ab
See the line where the sky meets the sea? It calls me
           Bbm               Gb
And no one knows, how far it goes
       Db                                   Ab
If the wind in my sail on the sea stays behind me
             Bbm                Gbm
One day I'll know, how far I'll go

I focus on the pain, the only thing thats real

 But in your life you'll do things greater than
            G           D/F#     Cadd9

 But I realized some bigger dreams of mine

 And Abigail gave everything she had to a boy

 Who changed his mind and we both cried

 And you just might find who you're supposed to be

 I didn't know who I was supposed to be

Bury all your secrets in my skin

Come away with innocence, and leave me with my sins
 Am                         Em       F   C

 Am                           Em   F                       C
And love is just a camouflage for what resembles rage again…

So if you love me, let me go. And run away before I know.

My heart is just too dark to care. I can't destroy what isn't there.
                    G                            Am
Deliver me into my fate - if I'm alone I cannot hate

I don't deserve to have you…

And cherish them in parts of me that savor every kiss

I couldn't face a life without your light

So save your breath, I will not hear. I think I made it very clear.

You couldn't hate enough to love. Is that supposed to be enough?

I only wish you weren't my friend. Then I could hurt you in the end.
                          G
I never claimed to be a Saint…

My own was banished long ago, it took the Death of Hope to let you go

So Break Yourself Against My Stones

You Never Needed Any Help
                         Am
You Sold Me Out To Save Yourself

And I Won't Listen To Your Shame

You Ran Away - You're All The Same

Angels Lie To Keep Control…

Love someone for loving you instead of someone really cool that makes your heart melt

Who knows what you truly felt
                E
You're still my favourite girl

CAPO 2ND FRET
 
[Verse 1]
G
Waking up to kiss you and nobody’s there
Em7
The smell of your perfume still stuck in the air
Cadd9
It’s hard
G
Yesterday I thought I saw your shadow running round
     Em7
It’s funny how things never change in this old town
   Cadd9        D
So far from the stars
 
[Pre-Chorus]
Am7                      D
  And I want to tell you everything
                  G              G/F#        Em7
The words I never got to say the first time around
Am7              D
  And I remember everything
                      G                   G/F#    Em7
From when we were the children playing in this fairground
                          C
Wish I was there with you now
 
[Chorus]
       Em7
If the whole world was watching I’d still dance with you
      Cadd9
Drive highways and byways to be there with you
G
Over and over the only truth
Em   D           G       Cadd9
Everything comes back to you
Em7  D G
Mmm-mm-mm
 
[Verse 2]
  G
I saw that you moved on with someone new
       Em
In the pub that we met he’s got his arms around you
     Cadd9
It’s so hard
   D
So hard

Everything comes back to you

You still make me nervous when you walk in the room

Them butterflies they come alive when I’m next to you
Cadd9
Over and over the only truth
Em7   D           G       Cadd9
Everything comes back to you
Em7  D G
Mmm-mm-mm
 
[Bridge]
Em7                     D/F#

                  G
That I can’t move on
                            Cadd9
But there’s something about you
 
[Chorus]
       Em7
If the whole world was watching I’d still dance with you

Drive highways and byways to be there with you

Over and over the only truth
Em7   D           G       Cadd9
Everything comes back to you

You still make me nervous when you walk in the room

Over and over the only truth

First tab written down properly, so it's a bit scratchy. Seems like a lot of chords,
but once you figure it out it's all simple progressions and patterns, nice and easy :)
Am working on tabbing the lead, but will take a while as I'm only a rhythm guitarist.

                   D
I've never seen a diamond in the flesh
         D
I cut my teeth on wedding rings in the movies
            D
And I'm not proud of my address - in the torn up town
 
No postcode envy
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
                        D
But every song's like: gold teeth, grey goose, trippin' in the bathroom
 
Blood stains, ballgowns, trashin' the hotel room
C                             G
We don't care - we're driving Cadillacs in our dreams
                     D
But everybody's like Cristal, Mayback, diamonds on your timepiece
 
Jet planes, islands, tigers on a gold leash
C                         G
We don't care - we aren't caught up in your love affair
 
 
[Chorus]
                   D
And we'll never be royals - it don't run in our blood
             C
That kind of lux just ain't for us
           G
We crave a different kind of buzz
               D
Let me be your ruler - you can call me Queen Bee
              C
And baby I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule
G                         D
  Let me live that fantasy
 
 
[Verse 2]
               D
My friends and I, we've cracked the code
             D
We count our dollars on the train to the party
         D
And everyone who knows us knows that we're fine with this
 
We didn't come from money
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]

[Verse 1]
C                                       C/B    Am
I am just a poor boy, though my story's seldom told
       G
I have squandered my resistance
      G7           G6               C
For a pocketful of mumbles such are promises
    C/B      Am           G                 F
All lies and jest still a man hears what he wants to hear
                   C      G    F G C
And disregards the rest
 
       C                                     C/B    Am
When I left my home and family I was no more than a boy
       G
In the company of strangers
       G7         G6              C
In the quiet of a railway station running scared
C/B    Am          G              F                                C
Laying low seeking out the poorer quarters where the ragged people go
        G              F    G          C
Looking for the places only they would know

[Verse 2]
       C                                  C/B   Am
Asking only workmans wages I come looking for a job
             G
But I get no offers
       G7               G6                C
Just a come-on from the whores on Seventh Avenue

Now the years are rolling by me, they are rocking evenly
         G
And I am older than I once was
    G7                G6               C

No, it isn't strange, after changes upon changes we are more or less the same

      G              G7            G6             C
Going home where the New York City winters aren't bleeding me

And he carries the reminders

Of ev'ry glove that laid him down or cut him till he cried out

A                   C#m           D                A
Crazy Chester followed me and he caught me in the fog.
A                   C#m           D                A
He said, ""I will fix your rack, if you'll take Jack my dog.""
A                   C#m           D                A
I said, ""Wait a minute, Chester. You know I'm a peaceful man.""
A                   C#m           D                A
He said, ""That's okay, boy.  Won't you feed him when you can?""

...""Son, have you seen the world?

                           B
I said ""That sounds pretty good.""
 
[Verse 2]
              E
Black leather boots,
                G#m
Spit-shined, so bright.
                A
They cut off my hair,
               E
But it looks alright.
                  A
We marched and we sang.
              E
We all became friends,
                     B
As we learned how to fight.
 
[Chorus 1]
          C#m
A hero of war!
                       A
Yeah, that's what I'll be.
                E
And when I come home,
                         B
They'll be damn proud of me.
                C#m
I'll carry this flag;
                    A
To the  grave, if I must.
                          E
'Cause it's a flag that I love
                   B
And it's flag that  I trust.
 
[Verse 3]
                E
I kicked in the door,
            G#m
I yelled my commands.
                   A
The children, they cried,
             E
But I got my man.
            A
We took him away,
               E
A bag over his face,
                        B
From his family and his friends.
 
[Verse 4]
                  E
They took off his clothes,
                   G#m
They pissed in his hands.
               A
I told them to stop,
                   E
But then, I joined in.
                 A
We beat him with guns
                     E
And batons, not just once,
               B
But again and again.
 
[Chorus 1]

A hero of war!

Yeah, that's what I'll be.

                                   She...
 
[Verse 5]
   E                          G#m
...walked through bullets and haze.
               A
I asked her to stop;
                E
I begged her to stay.
                A
But she pressed on,
               E
So I lifted my gun
            B
And I fired away...
 
[Verse 6]
        E
And the shells
                   G#m
Jumped through the smoke.
             A
And into the sand,
                       E
That the blood now had soaked,
        A
She collapsed,
                   E
With a flag in her hand.
                B
A flag white as snow.
 
[Chorus 2]
          C#m
A hero of war!
                  A
Is that what they see?
               E
Just medals and scars?
                 B
So damn proud of me.
                        C#m
And I brought home that flag.
               A
Now it gathers dust.
                       E
But it's a flag that I love.
                     B
It's the only flag I trust.
 
[Outro]

He said ""Son, have you seen the world?

Well, what would you say
                   E

Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
     D
Said baby I just want to dance
 
[Verse 1]
             Em             G
I met her on Grafton street right outside of the bar
             D                       C
She shared a cigarette with me while her brother played the guitar
             Em                    G
She asked me what does it mean the Gaelic ink on your arm?
            D                                                G
Said it was one of my friend’s songs do you want to drink on?
 
         Em            G
She took Jamie as a chaser, Jack for the fun
        D                    C
She got Arthur on the table, with Johnny riding a shotgun
Am7                G
Chatted some more, one more drink at the bar
         D
Then put Van on the jukebox, got up to dance, you know
 
[Chorus 1]
    C                 G
She played the fiddle in an Irish band
        D            C
But she fell in love with an English man
C                          G
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
     D
Said baby I just want to dance
                      Cadd9 G     D     Em
With my pretty little Galway Girl
                        Cadd9 G     D     Em
You’re my pretty little Galway Girl
 
[Verse 2]
             Em                   G
You know she beat me at darts and then she beat me at pool
             D                          C
And then she kissed me like there was nobody else in the room
        Em                     G
As last orders were called was when she stood on the stool
      D                                     G
After dancing to Ceili singing to trad tunes
 
        Em                  G
I never heard Carrickfergus ever sung so sweet
     D                  C
A cappella in the bar using her feet for the beat
            Am7                     G
Oh, I could have that voice playing on repeat for a week
            D
And in this packed out room swear she was singing to me, you know
 
[Chorus 2]
    C                 G
She played the fiddle in an Irish band
        D            C
But she fell in love with an English man
C                          G
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
     D
Said baby I just want to dance
 
                      Cadd9  G
With my pretty little Galway Girl
D           Em              Cadd9 G
 My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
D           Em              Cadd9 G
 My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
D           Em              Cadd9 G    D  Em
 My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
 
[Verse 3]
          Em                    G
Now we’ve outstayed our welcome and it’s closing time
     D                      C
I was holding her hand, her hand was holding mine
    Em                  G
Our coats both smell of smoke, whisky and wine
      D
As we fill up our lungs with the cold air of the night
 
 Em               G
I walked her home then she took me inside
       D                 C
Finish some Doritos and another bottle of wine
  Em                         G
I swear I’m going to put you in a song that I write
        D
About a Galway Girl and a perfect night
 
[Chorus 3]
    Em                G
She played the fiddle in an Irish band
        D            C
But she fell in love with an English man
C                          G
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
     D
Said baby I just want to dance

With my pretty little Galway Girl
D           Em              Cadd9 G
 My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
D           Em              Cadd9 G
 My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
D           Em              Cadd9 G    D  Em

[Verse 1]
 
Em                            C     Am
 Have you got colour in your cheeks?
Am                                        Em
 Do you ever get the fear that you can't shift the type
                         Em
that sticks around like summat in your teeth?
                C             Am
Are there some aces up your sleeve?
                                 Em
Have you no idea that you're in deep?
                           Em
I dreamt about you nearly every night this week
          C             Am
How many secrets can you keep?
                                    Em
Cause there's this tune I found that makes me think of you somehow
      Em
And I play it on repeat
C         Am
 Until I fall asleep
                       B
Spilling drinks on my settee
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
 
      C
Do I wanna know
         Am
if this feeling flows both ways?
        Em
Sad to see you go
          Em
Was sorta hoping that you'd stay
      C
Baby we both know
          Am
That the nights were mainly made
             Em                               Em
for saying things that you can't say tomorrow day

                  Em
Crawlin' back to you
                C       Am

             Em
Cos I always do
          Em             C         Am
Maybe I'm too busy being yours to fall for somebody new
                     Em
Now I've thought it through
                  Em
Crawlin' back to you
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
                    C    Am
So have you got the guts?
                                    Em
Been wondering if your hearts still open
                   Em
And if so I wanna know what time it shuts
C              Am
 Simmer down and pucker up
 
I'm sorry to interrupt
     Em
It's just I'm constantly on the cusp
             C        Am
Of trying to kiss you
                              Em
I don't know if you feel the same as I do
               C        Am
But we could be together
              B
if you wanted to

[Verse 1]
  C                                  F
I drove by all the places we used to hang out getting wasted
  C                                      F
I thought about our last kiss how it felt the way you tasted
    Am                                      F
And even though your friends tell me you're doing fine
        C                             F
Are you somewhere feeling lonely even though he's right beside you
        C                                     F
When he says those words that hurt you do you read the ones I wrote you?
 
    Am                             F
Sometimes I start to wonder was it just a lie?
   Am                             F
If what we had was real how could you be fine?
 
Cause I'm not fine at all
 
[Chorus]
    C                                   C/B
I remember the day you told me you were leaving
    Am                                  F
I remember the makeup running down your face
        C                                 C/B
And the dreams you left behind you didn't need them
     Am                        F
Like every single wish we ever made
 
  C                                C/B
I wish that I could wake up with amnesia
       Am                          F
And forget about the stupid little things
         C                               C/B
Like the way it felt to fall asleep next to you
        Am                   F
And the memories I never can escape
                          C F
Cause I'm not fine at all
 
[Verse 2]
    C                                       F
The pictures that you sent me they're still living in my phone
       C                            F
I'll admit I like to see them I'll admit I feel alone
Am                                 F
All my friends keep asking why I'm not around
   C                                 F
It hurts to know you're happy and it hurts that you've moved on
     C                                     F
It's hard to hear your name when I haven't seen you in so long
 
     Am                            F
It's like we never happened was it just a lie?
   Am                             F
If what we had was real how could you be fine?
 
Cause I'm not fine at all

[Bridge]
     G/B                            Am
If today I woke up with you right beside me
     F                                 C/E
Like all of this was just some twisted dream
    G/B                         Am
I'd hold you closer than I ever did before
          F
And you'd never slip away
          F
And you'd never hear me say
 
[Chorus]
    C                                   C/B
I remember the day you told me you were leaving

[Verse 1]
 
D                       A
I'd never gone with the wind
            Em
Just let it flow
       G            (A)          D
Let it take me where it wants to go
                  A                    Em
Till you open the door there's so much more
           G
I've never seen it before
      A         Bm        G
I was trying to fly but I couldn't find wings
    A          Bm          G
But you came along and you changed everything
 
 
[Chorus]
 
D                        A
You lift my feet off the ground
              Bm
You spin me around
            G
You make me crazier, crazier
D                          A
Feels like I'm falling and I
                 Bm
I'm lost in your eyes
            G                (G)
You make me crazier, crazier, crazier
 
 
[Verse]
 
  D                          A
I watched from a distance as you
               Em
Made life your own
      G           (A)          D
Every sky was your own kind of blue
                A                   Em
And I wanted to know how that would feel
        G
And you made it so real
A             Bm             G
You showed me something that I couldn't see
A             Bm           G
You opened my eyes and you made me believe
 
 
[Chorus]
 
D                        A
You lift my feet off the ground

You make me crazier, crazier
D                          A
Feels like I'm falling and I

I'm lost in your eyes

I don't want to hide anymore
 
 
[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
 
    Em                      C
The snow glows white on the mountain tonight
      D               Am
Not a footprint to be seen
  Em             C            D                  Am
A kingdom of isolation and it looks like I'm the Queen

 The wind is howling like the swirling storm inside

 Couldn't keep it in, heaven knows I tried

Be the good girl
 
You always had to be

 Conceal, don't feel

Let it go

Let it go
    C
The cold never bothered me anyway
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
     Em             C
It's funny how some distance
      D               Am
Makes everything seem small
        Em                 C
And the fears that once controlled me
      D             A
Can't get to me at all
Em             C
Up here in the cold thin air

I finally can breathe
  Em            C                   D               A

 Standing frozen in the life I've chosen
G         D        Em           C
 You won't find me, the past is so behind me
G      D       Em      C
 Buried in the snow

C                    Dm7
Once upon a time you dressed so fine
    Em                    F            G
You threw the bums a dime in your prime,   didn't you?
C                      Dm7
  People'd call, say, ""Beware doll, 
       Em                         F             G
you're bound to fall"" You thought they were all  a kiddin' you
 
F             G
  You used to   laugh about
F                    G
  Everybody that was   hangin' out
 
F         Em   Dm7         C
 Now you don't talk so loud
F         Em   Dm7          C
 Now you don't seem so proud
 
     Dm7                     F              G
About having to be scrounging for your next meal.
 
[Chorus]

How does it feel
                C  F  G
How does it feel
                    C  F  G
To be without a home
                       C  F  G

Aww, You've gone to the finest school all right, Miss Lonely
        F                         G
But you know you only used to get   juiced in it
  C                        Dm7                    Em
Nobody has ever taught you how to live out on the street
               F                 G
And now you're gonna have to get   used to it
 
F                    G
  You said you'd never  compromise
F                                    G
  With the mystery tramp, but now you  realize
 
F         Em         Dm7     C
 He's not selling any  alibis
F                      Em      Dm7       C
 As you stare into the vacuum  of his eyes
 
    Dm7               F        G
And say do you want to  make a deal?
 
[Chorus]
                C  F  G
How does it feel
                C  F  G

Aww, You never turned around to see the frowns 
                        F                        G
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all did   tricks for you
    C                        Dm7
You never understood that it ain't no good
    Em                  F               G
You shouldn't let other people get your   kicks for you
 
F                                                G
  You used to ride on the chrome horse with your   diplomat
F                               G
  Who carried on his shoulder a   Siamese cat
 
F             Em            Dm7      C
 Ain't it hard  when you discover that
F          Em      Dm7         C
 He really wasn't  where it's at
     Dm7                         F          G
After he took from you everything  he could steal.
 
[Chorus]

Aww, Princess on the steeple and all the pretty people
            F                            G
They're all drinkin', thinkin' that they   got it made
C                Dm7          Em
 Exchanging all precious gifts
                 F                      G
But you'd better take your diamond ring, you'd better pawn it babe
 
F               G
  You used to be so amused
F                    G
  At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used
 
F                  Em             Dm7         C
 Go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse
F                   Em              Dm7            C
 When you ain't got nothing, you got nothing to lose
       Dm7                       F           G
 You're invisible now, you got no secrets to conceal.

        C           D
But she wants to be sure
          F                             G   Am
cause you know sometimes words have two meanings.
     Am          E+
In a tree by the brook
          C            D
There’s a songbird who sings,
          F                       G  Am
Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven.
 
Am E+ C D F  G Am
 
D                Am    Em D C D
Ooh, it makes me wonder,
D  Dsus4 D                Am    Em D C D
Ooh,      and it makes me wonder.
 
          C         G
There’s a feeling I get
       Am
When I look to the west,
       C         G          F   Am
And my spirit is crying for leaving.
      C               G
In my thoughts I have seen
         Am
Rings of smoke through the trees,
        C         G               F   Am
And the voices of those who stand looking.
 
C  G  Am
 
D                Am    Em D C D
Ooh, it makes me wonder,
D  Dsus4 D                Am    Em D C D
Ooh,      and it makes me wonder.
 
        C              G
And its whispered that soon
      Am
If we all call the tune
         C          G          F   Am
Then the piper will lead us to reason.
      C            G
And a new day will dawn
    Am
For those who stand long
        C            G         F    Am
And the forests will echo with laughter.
 
C  G  Am
 
Am D   Am  Em D C D
 
Am
Ooooh
 
D        Am   Em D C D
Oooooooh
 
C            G              Am
If there’s a bustle in your hedgerow
          G**
Don’t be alarmed now,
C           G                    Am
It’s just a spring clean for the may queen.
C              G                 Am
Yes, there are two paths you can go by
           G**
But in the long run
C             G                  Am
There’s still time to change the road you’re on.
D                Am    Em D C D
Ooh, it makes me wonder
 
C            G              Am
Your head is humming and it won’t go
        G
In case you don’t know,
C          G              Am
The pipers calling you to join him,
C          G                Am
Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow,
        G
And did you know
C             G           Am              C G Am
Your stairway lies on the whispering wind.
 
D Dsus2 D Dsus4 D Dsus2 D Dsus4  C Cadd9 C Cadd9 C  2x
 
Am        G                F   G \ Am
And as we wind on down the road
            G               F   G \ Am
Our shadows taller than our soul.
              G           F   G \ Am
There walks a lady we all know
           G                        F   G \ Am
Who shines white light and wants to show
         G                    F   G \ Am
How everything still turns to gold.
           G           F   G \ Am
And if you listen very hard
              G              F   G \ Am
The tune will come to you at last.
             G              F  G \ Am
When all are one and one is all
        G               F
To be a rock and not to roll.
 
          F        G              Am
And she’s buying a stairway to heaven.
 
* E+ is an E augmented chord...perhaps the easiest way to play it is:
1st finger, first fret G string
2nd finger, first fret B string
3rd finger, 2nd fret D string
 
**  It has been suggested to stay on Am rather then switch to G
*** It has been suggested that all F chords should be Fmaj7 chords.

[Intro]
 
Bb  F  Bb  F  (x2)
 
 
[Verse 1]
 
Bb
Sitting here wasted and wounded
              F
At this old piano
       Bb
Trying hard to capture the moment
               F
This morning I don't know
         Am                      Bb
'Cause a bottle of vodka's still lodged in my head
         F
And some blond gave me nightmares
                             Bb
Think that she's still in my bed
      Bb                     C                         F
As I dream about movies they won't make of me when I'm dead
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
        Bb
With an iron-clad fist
                               F
I wake up, and French kiss the morning
           Bb
While some marching band keeps its own beat
                      F
In my head while we're talking
      Am                         Bb
About all of the things, that I long to believe
       F
About love, the truth, what you mean to me
        Bb
And the truth is
 Bb          C           F   F  C  C*
Baby, you're all that I need
 
 
[Chorus]
 
         Dm Dm
I wanna lay
     C        Bb     F
You down in a bed of roses
       Dm  Dm
For tonight
  C          Bb     F
I sleep on a bed of nails
              Bb
Oh, I want to be
        F
Just as close as
    Bb   F
The Holy Ghost is
    Dm  C   Bb  Bb
And lay you down
Bb     Bb*    F
  On a bed of roses
 
 
[Verse 3]
 
          Bb
Well, I'm so far away
                              F
Each step that I take's on my way home
          Bb
A King's ransom in dimes
                                       F
I give each night to see through this payphone
        Am
Still I run out of time
         Bb
Or it's hard to get through
          F
Till the bird on the wire flies me back to you
      Bb
I'll just close my eyes, and whisper
Bb    C             F  F  C  C*
Baby, blind love is true
 
 
[Chorus]
 
         Dm Dm
I wanna lay

I sleep on a bed of nails

Oh, I want to be

Just as close as

And lay you down
Bb     Bb*    F     C
  On a bed of roses
 
 
[Bridge]
 
            Bb
Well, this hotel bar hangover
  C                         F
Whiskey's gone dry, the barkeeper's wig's crooked
 
And she's giving me the eye
   Bb
I might have said yeah
       Bb             C          F  F C   C*
But I laughed so hard I think I died, uh yeah!...

[Verse 4]

Now as you close your eyes
                        F
Know I'll be thinking about you
          Bb
While my mistress she calls me
                         F
To stand in her spotlight again
            Bb
Tonight, I won't be alone
                                      F
But you know that don't mean I'm not lonely
         Dm         C              Bb
I've got nothing to prove for it's you

That I'd die to defend

C                 F                  C
O holy night, the stars are brightly shining;
                       G7            C
It is the night of the dear Savior’s birth!
C                     F             C
Long lay the world in sin and error pining,
          Em             B7            Em
Till He appeared and the soul felt its worth.
  G7                  C
A thrill of hope, the weary soul rejoices,
    G7              C
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn.
 
Am           Em       Dm             Am
Fall on your knees, O hear the angel voices!
  C G7  C  F      C   G7                C
O night divine, O night when Christ was born!
  G7       C F  C    G7          C
O night, O holy night, O night divine!
 
C                   F              C
Led by the light of faith serenely beaming,
                           G7        C
With glowing hearts by His cradle we stand.
C                    F            C
So led by light of a star sweetly gleaming,
              Em            B7     Em
Here came the wise men from Orient land.
    G7                C
The King of kings lay thus in lowly manger,
   G7             C
In all our trials born to be our friend!
 
Am           Em       Dm             Am
Fall on your knees, O hear the angel voices!
  C G7  C  F      C     G7              C
O night divine, O night when Christ was born!

O night, O holy night, O night divine!
 
C                     F         C
Truly He taught us to love one another;
                        G7        C
His law is love and His Gospel is peace.
C                             F            C
Chains shall He break for the slave is our brother
           Em         B7             Em
And in His Name all oppression shall cease.
      G7              C
Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we,
    G7            C
Let all within us praise His holy Name!
 
Am           Em       Dm             Am
Fall on your knees, O hear the angel voices!

O night divine, O night when Christ was born!

                Em
It's not up to you
              C
It's not up to me
              G                   D/F#
When everyone tells us what we can be
            Em         C
How can we rewrite the stars?
             G          D/F#
Say that the world can be ours
 
Tonight
 
[Bridge]
Zac Efron and Zendaya
Em              C          G
All I want is to fly with you
                D/F#       Em
All I want is to fall with you
                Bm      C
So just give me all of you
 
(Zendaya)
C
It feels impossible
(Zac Efron)
C
It's not impossible
(Zendaya)
C
Is it impossible?
(Both)
              C
Say that it's possible
 
[Chorus]
Zac Efron and Zendaya
            Em       C
How do we rewrite the stars?
             G         D/F#
Say you were made to be mine?
            Em     C
Nothing can keep us apart
                  G                 D/F#
Cause you are the one I was meant to find
            Em
It's up to you
              C
And it's up to me
           G                D/F#
No one can say what we get to be
                  Em         C
And why don't we rewrite the stars?
              G        D/F#
Changing the world to be ours
 
G
 
[Outro]
Zendaya
G
You know I want you
G
It's not a secret I try to hide
G
But I can't have you
G
We're bound to break and
G
My hands are tied

And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again

We've come a long way from where we began

[Verse]
D                            F#m
Hey there Delilah, what’s it like in New York City? 
      D                               F#m
I’m a thousand miles away, but girl tonight you look so pretty, 
        Bm  G                 A                  Bm
Yes you do, Time Square can’t shine as bright as you, 
             A
I swear it’s true.
D                            F#m
Hey there Delilah, don’t you worry about the distance, 
          D                                  F#m
I’m right there if you get lonely, give this song another listen, 
           Bm    G            A                Bm
Close your eyes, listen to my voice it’s my disguise, 
            A
I’m by your side.
 
[Chorus]
D                      Bm  D                      Bm     A
Oh it’s what you do to me, Oh it’s what you do to me, 
D                      Bm  D                      Bm
Oh it’s what you do to me, Oh it’s what you do to me, 
               D
What you do to me.
 
[Verse]
D                         F#m
Hey there Delilah, I know times are getting hard, 
           D                                    F#m
But just believe me girl some day, I'll pay the bills with this guitar, 
              Bm    G              A               Bm
We'll have it good, we'll have the life we knew we would, 
           A
My word is good.
D                           F#m
Hey there Delilah, I’ve got so much left to say, 
         D                                 F#m
If every simple song I wrote to you, would take your breath away, 
             Bm   G            A                  Bm
I’d write it all, even more in love with me you’d fall, 
             A
We’d have it all.
 
[Chorus]
D                      Bm  D                      Bm    A
Oh it’s what you do to me, Oh it’s what you do to me, 
D                      Bm  D                      Bm    A
Oh it’s what you do to me, Oh it’s what you do to me, 
 
[Bridge]
G                                      A
A thousand miles seems pretty far, but they’ve got planes and trains and cars, 
D                                 Bm
I’d walk to you if I had no other way 
G                                         A
Our friends would all make fun of us, and we'll just laugh along because, 
   D                                     Bm
We know that none of them have felt this way, 
G                               A
Delilah I can promise you, that by the time that we get through, 
    Bm                                               A
The world will never ever be the same, and you’re to blame.
 
[Verse 3]
D                        F#m
Hey there Delilah you be good, and don’t you miss me, 
         D                                         F#m
Two more years and you’ll be done with school, and I'll be making history, 
       Bm  G                A              Bm
Like I do, you’ll know it's all because of you, 
G             A            Bm
We can do whatever we want to, 
G           A               Bm                  A
Hey there Delilah here's to you, this one’s for you.
 
[Outro]
D                      Bm  D                      Bm    A
Oh it’s what you do to me, Oh it’s what you do to me, 
D                      Bm  D                      Bm
Oh it’s what you do to me, Oh it’s what you do to me, 
               D
What you do to me.

We are turning into dust

Playing house in the ruins of us

[Verse 1]
 
           C#m7
It's not a silly little moment
             Aadd9            E
It's not the storm before the calm
            C#m7
This is the deep and dying breath of
                          Aadd9   E
This love that we've been working on
 
              C#m7
Can't seem to hold you like I want to
         Aadd9          E
So I can feel you in my arms
         C#m7
Nobody's gonna come and save you
                      Aadd9   E
We've pulled too many false alarms
 
 
[Chorus]
 
            Badd11
We're going down
            C#m7   Aadd9
And you can see it too
            Badd11
We're going down

And you know that we're doomed

My dear, we're slow dancing in a burning room

[Verse 2]
 
          C#m7
I was the one you always dreamed of
             Aadd9           E
You were the one I tried to draw
             C#m7
How dare you say it's nothing to me
                      Aadd9        E
Baby, you're the only light I ever saw
 
              C#m7
I'll make the most of all the sadness
            Aadd9             E
You'll be a bitch because you can
           C#m7
You try to hit me just to hurt me so you leave me feeling dirty
           Aadd9      E
'Cause you can't understand
 
 
[Chorus]
 
            Badd11
We're going down
            C#m7   Aadd9
And you can see it too
            Badd11
We're going down
        C#m7            F#m11
And you know that we're doomed

Go cry about it, why don't you

Go cry about it, why don't you

Don't you think we should've learned somehow

Don't you think we oughta know by now
                             Aadd9         E

            C                Am7
There ain't no gold in this river
                Em                    Fmaj7
That I've been washing my hands in forever
G            C                 Am7
I know there is hope in these waters
             Em
But I can't bring myself to swim
    Fmaj7                  F
When I am drowning in this silence
            Fmaj7
Baby, let me in
 
[Chorus]
G C   Am7   G
Go easy    on me, baby
Em     Dm7
I was still a child
 C    Fmaj7              G
Didn’t get the chance to
C Am7    G
Feel the world around me
Em       Dm7
I had no time to choose
 C     Fmaj7
What I chose to do
       C        Am7  Em  Fmaj7
So go easy on me
 
[Verse 2]
 G          C
There ain't no room
               Am7
For things to change
             Em
When we are both so deeply
         Fmaj7
Stuck in our ways
 G         C
You can't deny
        Am7
How hard I have tried
          Em
I changed who I was
           Fmaj7
To put you both first
              Fmaj7
But now I give up
 
[Chorus]

Go easy    on me, baby

I was still a child
 C    Fmaj7
Didn’t get the chance to
C  Am7    G
Feel the world around me
Em       Dm7
I had no time to choose
 C     Fmaj7
What I chose to do
      C  Am7 Em     Fmaj7
So go easy      on me
 
[Bridge]
C                Am7
I had good intentions
            Em
And the highest hopes
                   Fmaj7
But I know right now
                         Fmaj7
It probably doesn't even show
 
[Outro]

Go easy    on me, baby

I was still a child
 C    Fmaj7
Didn’t get the chance to

Feel the world around me

I had no time to choose

What I chose to do

G    ** Em
 
 
[Verse 1]
     Em7                        D/F#         G
It'll be fine by dusk light I'm telling you baby
             G                           D/F#           Em
These things eat at your bones and drive your young mind crazy
        Em7                             D/F#     G
But when you place your head between my collar and jaw
G                             D/F#         Em7
I don't know much but there's no weight at all
 
 
[Verse 2]
       Em7                     D/F#       G
And I'm damned if I do and I'm damned if I don't
          G                  D/F#          Em7
'Cause if I say I miss you I know that you won't
     Em7                            D/F#       G
But I miss you in the mornings when I see the sun
G                             D/F#         Em7
Something in the orange tells me we're not done
 
 
[Chorus]
Cadd9                  G
To you I'm just a man, to me you're all I am
D                                Em7
Where the hell am I 'supposed to go?
  Cadd9
I poisoned myself again
G                       D                            Em7
Something in the orange tells me you're never coming home
   Cadd9                     G
If you leave today I'll just stare at the way
    D                          Em7
The orange touches all things around
    Cadd9                    G
The grass trees and dew, how I just hate you
D                             Em7
Please turn those headlights around

I need to hear you say you've been waitin' all night
        G                        D/F#         Em7
There's orange dancing in your eyes from bulb light
    Em7                       D/F#        G
Your voice only trembles when you try to speak
        G                        D/F#           Em7
Take me back to us dancing, this wood used to creak

To you I'm just a man, to me you're all I am

I've been counting to ten
 
Over something you said.

Loving you being one

Done looking for the critics, cuz they're everywhere

Em
 
[Verse 1]
Em                       B
  I see a red door and I want it painted black.
Em                      B
  No colours anymore, I want them to turn black.
Em  D       G          D          Em
  I see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes.
Em  D       G       D       A               B
  I have to turn my head until my darkness goes.
 
[Verse 2]
Em                         B
  I see a line of cars and they're all painted black.
Em                              B
  With flowers and my love both never to come back.
Em  D          G          D         Em
  I see people turn their heads and quickly look away.
Em       D       G    D       A             B
  Like a newborn baby it just happens every day.
 
[Verse 3]
Em                         B
  I look inside myself and see my heart is black.
Em                          B
  I see my red door, I must have it painted black
Em      D         G     D       Em
  Maybe then I'll fade away and not have to face the facts.
Em         D    G      D       A                   B
  It's not easy facing up when your whole world is black.
 
[Verse 4]
Em                             B
  No more will my green sea go turn a deeper blue.
Em                              B
  I could not forsee this thing happening to you.
Em   D      G      D      Em
  If I look hard enough into the setting sun
Em   D         G          D     A                B
  My love will laugh with me before the morning comes.
 
[Verse 5]
Em                       B
  I see a red door and I want it painted black.
Em                      B
  No colours anymore, I want them to turn black.
Em  D       G          D          Em
  I see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes.
Em  D       G       D       A               B
  I have to turn my head until my darkness goes.
 
[Outro]
Em  B
Em  B
Em  B
Em  B
 
               Em                      B
I wanna see it painted, painted black, black as night, black as coal
  Em                        B
I wanna see the sun blotted out from the sky
               Em                                 B
I wanna see it painted, painted, painted, painted black, yeah

[Verse 1]
C
 Say you're sorry 
       F
That face of an angel
      Am                          F
Comes out just when you need it to 
C                     F
 As I paced back and forth all this time 
          Am                 F
'Cause I honestly believed in you 
Am
Holding on 
     F
The days drag on 
        Gsus4
Stupid girl
                                         G*
I should have known, I should have known 
 
 
[Chorus]
                 C                       Am
That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairytale 
            F
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet
 G
Lead her up the stairwell 
           C                     Am
This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town
        F                               G
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down 
         Am            G
Now it's too late for you 
           F                    C (C)
And your white horse, to come around 
 
 
[Verse 2]
C
 Maybe I was naive
F
 Got lost in your eyes 
    Am                       F
And never really had a chance 
C                    F
 My mistake I didn't know to be in love 
           Am                          F
You had to fight to have the upper hand 
      Am
I had so many dreams 
      F
About you and me 
      G
Happy endings, now I know 
 
 
[Chorus]
                 C                       Am
That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairytale 
            F
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet
 G
Lead her up the stairwell 
           C                     Am
This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town
          F                         G
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down 
         Am            G
Now it's too late for you 
           F                    C    Am F G
And your white horse, to come around 
 
 
[Bridge]
Am             G          F
 And there you are on your knees
C               G        F
 Begging for forgiveness, begging for me
C            G            F           Bb
 Just like I always wanted but I'm so sorry
 
 
[Chorus]
                      C                         Am
'Cause I'm not your princess, this ain't our fairytale 
          F                              G
I'm gonna find someone someday who might actually treat me well 
          C                     Am
This is a big world, that was a small town 
            F                    G
There in my rearview mirror disappearing now 
         Am           G              F
And it's too late for you and your white horse 
         Am           G              F                     C
Now it's too late for you and your white horse, to catch me now 
 
 
[Outro]
F      Am
 Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa
F                 C
 Try and catch me now
  F Am
 Oh, it's too late
F            C
 To catch me now

No, it's never been better

Than the summer of 2002

We were only eleven
      D
But acting like grownups
      A            Bm
Like we are in the present
        Bm
Drinking from plastic cups

Singing love is forever and ever

Of an old Mustang, where we sang

Songs with all our childhood friends
 
And it went like this, say

Oops I got 99 problems singing bye, bye, bye

Now we're under the covers

You need to borrow
C              F

              C
Those of your needs
               G7  C

[Verse 1]
G                    D
I am not the kind of girl
              Am
Who should be rudely barging in
     C
On a white veil occasion

But you are not the kind of boy

Who should be marrying the wrong girl
 
[Verse 2]
G                       D
I sneak in and see your friends
        Am
And her snotty little family
    C
All dressed in pastel
    G                   D
And she is yelling at a bridesmaid
          Am
Somewhere back inside a room
          C
Wearing a gown shaped like a pastry
 
[Pre-chorus 1]
Am      C      G
Thi--is i---is surely not
                          D
What you thought it would be
Am   C                  D
I---I  lose myself in a daydream
 
Where I stand and say
 
[Chorus]
G                  D
  Don't say ""Yes"", run away now
     Am
I'll meet you when you're out
       C
Of the church at the back door
G               D
  Don't wait or say a single vow
    Am
You need to hear me out
         C     N.C.
And they said ""Speak Now""
 
[Instrumental]
G   D   Am   C
 
[Verse 3]
G                   D
Fond gestures are exchanged
        Am
And the organ starts to play a song
     C
That sounds like a death march
    G                  D
And I am hiding in the curtains
              Am
It seems that I was uninvited
        C
By your lovely bride-to-be
 
[Pre-chorus 2]
Am      C
She---e floats down the aisle
       G            D
Like a pageant queen
    Am   C
But I--I kno--ow 
    G
You wish it was me
    D           N.C.
You wish it was me - Don't you?
 
[Chorus]
G                  D
  Don't say ""Yes"", run away now

Your time is running out
         C
And they said ""Speak Now""
 
G   D      Am    C
    Ohooho laaaahhoh
G   D                  Am          C
    Oooh (Say a single vow) ooohooh
 
[Bridge]
Em*                     C*
I hear the preacher say speak now
           G*        D*   D
Or forever hold your pe---ace
Am
There's a silence, there's my last chance
C
I stand up with shaky hands
    G       D*
All eyes on me
Am                   C
Horrified looks from everyone in the room
    D                   D*
But I'm only lookin' at you
 
[Verse 4]
G                    D
I am not the kind of girl
              Am
Who should be rudely barging in
     C
On a white veil occasion
    G                       D
But you are not the kind of boy

 So don't say ""Yes"", run away now
     Am
I'll meet you when you're out
       C
Of the church at the back door
G               D
  Don't wait or say a single vow
    Am
You need to hear me out
     C
They said ""Speak Now""
 
G                    D
  And you say ""Let's run away now""
     Am
I'll meet you when I'm out
      C
Of my tux at the back door
G         D
  Baby, I didn't say my vows
   Am
So glad you were around
          C                G*
When they said ""Speak no--ow""

I'm gonna make a change,    for once in my life

          G           D/F#             Em            D
I see the kids in the street, with not enough to eat
          C
Who am I, to be blind, pretending not to see their needs
 
Am7                  G/B
 A summer's disregard, a broken bottle top
C                 G/B
 And a one man's soul

    Am                              C/B
The shadow in the background of the morgue
                 C         C/B
The unsuspecting victim of darkness in the valley
       Am                             C/B
We can live like Jack and Sally if we want
                     C
Where you can always find me
               C/B
And we'll have Halloween on Christmas
    Am                                 G/B
And in the night we'll wish this never ends
                       C
We'll wish this never ends

Where are you and I'm so sorry
  Am                            C/B
I cannot sleep I cannot dream tonight
                    C
I need somebody and always
     C/B
This sick strange darkness
      Am                            G/B
Comes creeping on so haunting every time
                  C
And as I stared I counted
C/B
Webs from all the spiders
Am                                 C/B
Catching things and eating their insides
                   C
Like indecision to call you
    C/B
and hear your voice of treason
     Am                                 G/B
Will you come home and stop this pain tonight
 
Stop this pain tonight

F            G
Now here you go again
       F               G
You say you want your freedom
F            G                 F        G
Well, who am I to keep you down?
F             G                 F                 G
It's only right that you should play the way you feel it

But listen carefully to the sound

Of your loneliness, like a heartbeat, drives you mad

In the stillness of remembering what you had

Am
This is the greatest and best song in the world...   Tribute.
 
 
[Verse 1]
 
Am
Long time ago me and my brother Kyle here,
Am
We was hitchhikin' down a long and lonesome road.
Am
All of a sudden, there shined a shiny demon...
Am
In the middle of the road.
Am
And he said:
 
 
(strum palm muted)
 
A5
""Play the best song in the world, or I'll eat your souls.""
 
 
(back to normal picking)
 
Am
Well me and Kyle, we looked at each other,
Am
And we each said...   ""Okay""
 
Am                                 G
And we played the first thing that came to our heads,
F
Just so happened to be,
Am                   G             F
The Best Song in the World, it was The Best Song in the World.
 
 
[Chorus 1]
 
D                          F
Look into my eyes and it's easy to see
        C                     G
One and one make two, two and one make three,
        F
It was destiny.
D                           F
Once every hundred-thousand years or so,
         C                      G
When the sun doth shine and the moon doth glow

And accept it that soon you'll be drenched to the bone
        G       Am           D
If your time to you is worth savin'
         D            D7                 D6          D
Then you better start swimmin' or you'll sink like a stone,
        G           C     D   G
For the times, they are a-changin'
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
     G           Em                C              G
Come writers and critics who prophesize with your pen
    G              Am              C           D
And keep your eyes wide the chance won't come again
    G               Em           C                G
And don't speak too soon for the wheel's still in spin
            G          Am            D
And there's no tellin' who that it's namin'
         D       D7       D6       D
For the loser now will be later to win
        G          C     D   G
For the times they are a-changin'
 
 
[Verse 3]
 
     G         Em          C               G
Come senators, congressmen please heed the call
      G            Am             C            D
Don't stand in the doorway, don't block up the hall
    G            Em           C          G
For he that gets hurt will be he who has stalled
          G         Am            D
There's a battle outside and it's ragin'
         D             D7         D6          D
It'll soon shake your windows and rattle your walls
        G          C     D   G
For the times they are a-changin'
 
 
[Verse 4]
 
     G           Em      C              G
Come mothers and fathers throughout the land
    G          Am            C          D
And don't criticize what you can't understand
     G             Em              C            G
Your sons and your daughters are beyond your command
     G           Am      D
Your old road is rapidly agin'
         D             D7            D6              D
Please get out of the new one if you can't lend your hand
        G          C     D   G
For the times they are a-changin'
 
 
[Verse 5]
 
    G          Em        C           G
The line it is drawn the curse it is cast
    G        Am       C        D
The slow one now will later be fast
       G       Em       C        G
As the present now will later be past
    G        Am      D
The order is rapidly fadin'
         D         D7      D6       D
And the first one now will later be last
        G          C     D   G
For the times they are a-changin'

[Verse 1]
G                        C
  So she said what's the problem baby
G                             C
   What's the problem I don't know
                 Em
Well maybe I'm in love (love)
               A
Think about it everytime I think about it
C
Can't stop thinking 'bout it
 
G                         C
  How much longer will it take to cure this?
G                          C                       Em
  Just to cure it 'cause I can't ignore it if it's love (love)
               A                             D
Makes me wanna turn around and face me but I don't know
              C
Nothing 'bout love            Ahhhh
 
[Chorus]
G       Am

Turn a little faster
G        Am

[Verse 2]
G                 C
  So I said I'm a snowball running
G                        C                            Em
  Running down into the spring that's coming all this love
              A                      C
Melting under blue skies belting out sunlight
           G
shimmering love
          C                  G
Well baby I surrender to the strawberry ice cream
C                         Em
never ever end of all this love
       A
Well I didn't mean to do it
           D                C
But there's no escaping your love   ahhhhh

Come on, come on
C             D
Move a little closer
G        Am
Come on, come on
    C              D
I want to hear you whisper
G        Am
Come on, come on
C              D      Em  D
Settle down inside my love            Ahhhh
 
G        Am
Come on, come on
C             D
Jump a little higher
G        Am
Come on, come on
       C             D
If you feel a little lighter
G        Am
Come on, come on
   C                D       Em  A   C
We were once upon a time in love

Accidentally in love
 
             G                     C
Accidentally, I'm in love, I'm in love
                     Em
I'm in love, I'm in love
                     D
I'm in love, I'm in love
             G                     C
Accidentally, I'm in love, I'm in love
                     Em
I'm in love, I'm in love
                     D
I'm in love, I'm in love, accidentally
 
[Chorus]
G        Am
Come on, come on
C             D
Spin a little tighter
G        Am
Come on, come on
        C                D
And the world's a little brighter
G        Am
Come on, come on
     C              D        Em    D             G
Just get yourself inside her love.....I'm in love

[Verse 1]
 
Dm       C              Dm      C     Dm   C  Dm C
Now and then I think of when we were together
Dm            C                Dm     C        Dm  C Dm C
Like when you said you felt so happy you could die
Dm     C                  Dm         C
Told myself that you were right for me
Dm           C             Dm      C
But felt so lonely in your company
Dm            C                Dm       C     Dm    C  Dm  C
But that was love and it's an ache I still remember

[Verse]
 
Dm             C           Dm      C       Dm    C  Dm C
You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness
Dm         C            Dm
Like resignation to the end
C          Dm       C    Dm    C
Always the end
Dm          C                  Dm         C
So when we found that we could not make sense
Dm         C                 Dm        C
Well you said that we would still be friends
Dm          C              Dm       C       Dm    C  Dm  C
But I'll admit that I was glad that it was over
 
 
[Chorus]
 
Dm      C              Bb     C
But you didn't have to cut me off
Dm        C            Bb
Make out like it never happened
         C          Dm
And that we were nothing
    C             Bb       C
And I don't even need your love
         Dm              C
But you treat me like a stranger
          Bb       C
And that feels so rough
 
Dm    C              Bb      C
You didn't have to stoop so low
Dm         C                   Bb
Have your friends collect your records
          C           Dm
And then change your number
  C                  Bb          C
I guess that I don't need that though
Dm               C              Bb      C
Now you're just somebody that I used to know

Now and then I think of all the times you screwed me over
Dm          C                Dm              C        Dm   C Dm C
But had me believing it was always something that I'd done
C
And I don't wanna live that way
C
Reading into every word you say
C
You said that you could let it go
C                                      N.C.
And I wouldn't catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know

But you didn't have to cut me off

Now you're just somebody that I used to know
 
 
[Outro]
 
    Dm      C    Bb          C
Somebody...       I used to know
    Dm      C       Bb        C
Somebody...  That I used to know 
    Dm      C    Bb          C

Somebody... (Now you're just somebody that I used to know)
Dm    C   Bb       C
       I used to know  
Dm   C        Bb       C
      That I used to know     
Dm    C   Bb       C
       I used to know             
Dm        C   Bb   C

How many special people change
Asus2/G
How many lives are living strange
Asus2/F#                              Asus2/E
Where were you while we were getting high
 
Asus2
   Slowly walking down the hall
Asus2/G
Faster than a cannonball
Asus2/F#                              Asus2/E

Wipe that tear away now from your eye

G
You can be the prince and I can be your princess
D
You can be the sweet tooth, I can be the dentist
Em
You can be the shoes and I can be the laces
C
You can be heart that I spill on the pages.
 
G
You can be the vodka and I can be the chaser,
D
You can be the pencil and I can be paper
Em
You can be as cold as the winter  weather
C
But I don't care as long as we're together
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
 
G
Don't know if I could ever be
D
Without you coz boy you complete me
Em
And in time I know that we'll both see
C
That we're all we need
 
 
[Chorus]
 
                               G
'Cause you're the apple to my pie

You're the straw to my berry
                         Em

G                        D

[Verse 1]
 
Bm             A                     G
You, with your words like knives and swords
G
And weapons that you use against me 
Bm        A                 G
You, have knocked me off my feet again
G
Got me feelin' like a nothin'
Bm             A                     G
You, with your voice like nails on a chalk board
G
Callin' me out when I'm wounded
Bm   A                     G
You, pickin' on the weaker man
 
 
[Pre-Chorus 1]
 
A                        D               G      A
 Well you can take me down with just one single blow
    G*
But you don't know, what you don't know...
 
 
[Chorus]
 
D       A       Bm                  G
Someday I'll be livin' in a big ol' city 
    D          A                G
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
D       A       Bm                      G
Someday I'll be big enough so you can't hit me 
    D          A                G
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
                   D      C D
Why you gotta be so mean?
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
Bm             A
You, with your switching sides and
     G
Your wild fire lies and your humiliation
Bm        A              G
You, have pointed out my flaws again
       -stop
As if I don't already see them
Bm          A
I walk with my head down
          G
Tryin' to block you out 
         G
'Cause I never impress you
Bm     A           G
I just wanna feel okay again
 
 
[Pre-Chorus 2]
 
A
I bet you got pushed around
D        G        A
Somebody made you cold
A
But the cycle ends right now 'cause
G
You can't lead me down that road
                   G -stop
And you don't know what you don't know
 
 
[Chorus]
 
D       A       Bm                  G
Someday I'll be livin' in a big ol' city 
    D          A                G
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
D       A       Bm                      G
Someday I'll be big enough so you can't hit me 
    D          A                G
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
                   D     C D   A   G
Why you gotta be so mean?
 
 
[Bridge]
 
          A
And I can see you years from now in a bar
D               G            A
 Talkin' over a football game
A
With that same big loud opinion
D            G        A
But nobody's listening
A
Washed up and ranting about the 
D* *once   A*       G*
Same old   bitter   things
A                                 D* A*    G*
Drunk and grumblin' all about how I  can't sing
 no chord         D    A  Bm
But all you are is mean
 
[Interlude]
 
G              D            A          Bm
All you are is mean...and a liar...and pathetic
    G                 D         A         Bm        G
And alone in life and mean, and mean, and mean, and mean
 
 
*Palm mute first 2 lines*
    D       A       Bm                  G
But someday I'll be livin' in a big ol' city 
    D          A                G      G
And all you're ever gonna be is mean,  yeah--ah
 
 
[Chorus 2]
 
D       A       Bm                      G
Someday I'll be big enough so you can't hit me 
    D          A               G
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
G                   D
Why you gotta be so...Someday
A       Bm                 G
I'll be livin in a big ol' city why ya gotta be so mean
    D          A                G
And all you're ever gonna be is mean why ya gotta be so mean
D       A       Bm                      G
Someday I'll be big enough so you can't hit me why ya gotta be so mean
    D* *once   A*               G*
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
                   D*
Why you gotta be so  mean?

Tuning: Double Drop D (DADGBd)
 
Tune e to d
E to D
 
I’m pretty tired of dropping down to BDDDDD to play this song, so I thought I’d tab it
in an easier to get to tuning… with no popping strings (and if you DO pop one… that’s
sad).

[Verse 1]
 
                    F                 Am
Lovin' him is like, drivin' a new Maserati
                G
Down a dead end street
F                           Am
Faster than the wind, passionate as sin
         G
Ended so suddenly
                    F
Loving him is like, tryin' to change your mind
            Am                         G
Once you're already flying through the free fall
         F                  Am
Like the colors in autumn so bright
                 G          N.C.
Just before they lose it all
 
 
[Chorus]
 
               F                    C
Losing him was blue, like I'd never known
                G
Missing him was dark grey, all alone
                   F                       Am
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody
          G
You never met
                   F
But loving him was red
          Am        G
Re ee ed, re ee ed, re ee ed
               F
Lovin' him was red
          Am        G
Re ee ed, re ee ed, re ee ed
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
                       F                      Am
Touching him was like, realizing all you ever wanted
                   G
Was right there in front of you
                       F                       Am
Memorizing him was as, easy as knowin' all the words
                    G
To your old favorite song
                           F
Fighting with him was like tryin' to solve a
              Am                           G
Crossword and realizing there's no right answer
                        F                        Am
Regretting him was like wishing you never found out
                       G
That love could be that strong
 
 
[Chorus]
 
               F                    C
Losing him was blue, like I'd never known
                G
Missing him was dark grey, all alone
                   F                       Am
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody

Re ee ed, re ee ed, oh red, re ee ed

Burnin' red, re ee ed, re ee ed
G
Re ee ed,
 
 
[Bridge]
 
                         F               G
Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echos
                    Am             G/B
Tellin' myself it's time now gotta let go
     C              F
But moving on from him is impossible
     C/E                       G
When I still see it all in my, head
            F   Am  G
And burning red
       F          Am  G
Burning, it was reeeeed
 
 
[Chorus]

Comes back to me, burnin' red

Yeah, yeah

              G     D
   Oh, you're so naive yet so
Em                       C                             D/F#
   How could this be done, by such a smiling sweetheart
       G                   D
   Oh, and your sweet and pretty face
Em                        C                    D/F#
   In such an ugly world, something so beautiful
            G            D
   Oh, that every time I look inside
 
 
[Chorus]
 
C              G              D/F#
   I know, she knows that I'm not fond of asking
C                       G                        D/F#
   True or false, it may be... Well, she's still out to get me
C                  Em             D/F#
   And I know, she knows that I'm not fond of asking

[Verse]
 
Em                      C                             D/F#
   So how could this be done, by such a smiling sweetheart
          G      D
   You're so naive yet so
Em                           C                     D/F#
   You're such an ugly thing for someone so beautiful
        G                 D/F#
   That every time you're on his side
 
 
[Chorus]
 
C                   G         D/F#
   I know, she knows that I'm not fond of asking

B                                              F#
Look at the stars, look how they shine for you,
                       E
and everything you do
                           B
Yeah, they were all yellow
                                     F#
I came along, I wrote a song for you
                           E
and all the things you do
                          B
And it was called Yellow
                       F#
So then I took my turn

Oh, what a thing to have done
                       B
And it was all yellow

'Cause you were all yellow
                                      F#
I drew a line, I drew a line for you

What a beautiful face
                       C
I have found in this place
                  D
that is circling all 'round the sun

What a beautiful dream
                          C
that could flash on the screen
                  D                    G
in a blink of an eye and be gone from me

What a curious life we have found here tonight
                    D
There is music that sounds from the street

     Now how I remember you

How I would push my fingers through
                                    D
your mouth to make those muscles move
                                       Em
that made your voice so smooth and sweet
                                  C
But now we keep where we don't know
                                  G
All secrets sleep in winter clothes

[Verse 1]
    Am                Em
I'm sitting here in a boring room,
     Am                        Em
It's just another rainy Sunday afternoon.
    Am                     Em
I'm wasting my time, I got nothing to do.
    Am                  Em
I'm hanging around, I'm waiting for you,
    Dm           Em              Am       Em**  Am*
But nothing ever happens - and I wonder.
 
[Verse 2]
    Am               Em
I'm driving around - in my car,
    Am                    Em
I'm driving too fast, I'm driving too far.
    Am                Em
I'd like to change my point of view
  Am                  Em
I feel so lonely, I'm waiting for you
    Dm           Em              Am       Em**  Am*
But nothing ever happens - and I wonder.

  C             G
I wonder how, I wonder why
Am                              Em
Yesterday you told me 'bout the blue blue sky
    F              G                    C           G7
And all that I can see is just a yellow lemon tree.
    C                 G
I'm turning my head - up and down,
    Am                              Em
I'm turning turning turning turning turning around

    Am              Em
I'm sitting here, I miss the power.
    Am                 Em
I'd like to go out, taking a shower,
    Am                    Em
But there's a heavy cloud inside my head.
  Am                   Em
I feel so tired, put myself into bed,
      Dm           Em              Am       Em**  Am*
Where nothing ever happens - and I wonder.

Isolation - Is not good for me,
G           C               E
Isolation - I don't want to sit on a lemon tree.

I'm stepping around in a desert of joy
Am                    Em
Baby, anyhow I'll get another toy

And everything will happen - and you wonder.

Em                 Am     Em
    My lover's got humour
                      Am       G
She's the giggle at a funeral
                  Am          Em
Knows everybody's disapproval
                           Am      Em
I should've worshipped her sooner
                    Am         Em
If the Heavens ever did speak
                     Am          G
She is the last true mouthpiece

Every Sunday's getting more bleak
               Am           D
A fresh poison each week
                   C/G
'We were born sick,' you heard them say it
Em                      Am         Em
    My church offers no absolutes
                             Am        G
She tells me 'worship in the bedroom'
                        Am        Em
The only heaven I'll be sent to
                  Am         D
Is when I'm alone with you
                 C/G
I was born sick, but I love it
C/G
     Command me to be well

My lover's the sunlight

To keep the Goddess on my side
              Am          D
She demands a sacrifice
                        C/G
To drain the whole sea
                     Em
Get something shiny
                        Am           Em
Something meaty for the main course
                      Am            G
That's a fine looking high horse
                    Am        Em
What you got in the stable?
                        Am         D
We've a lot of starving faithful

There is no sweeter innocence than our gentle sin

Only then I am human, only then I am clean

""Baby, I don't feel so good"", 6 words you never understood

I laugh along like nothing's wrong, 4 days has never felt so long
         Am               D7            G     Em
If 3's a crowd and 2 is us, 1 slipped away

Is there a reason we're not through
           G                    Em
Is there a 12 step just for you

Our conversation's all in blue
    G    Em
11 heys

10 fingers pulling on my hair

To spare my pride
                       G                       Em
To give your lack of interest an explanation

I'm not your type
                    G                  Em
Maybe I'm not your preferred gender orientation
       Am     D7                      G          Em
I'm so selfish but you make me feel helpless
            Am             D7
And I can't stand another day
         G               Em
I can't stand another day

[Verse 1]
Dm       Bb                F        C
  Do you know what's worth fighting for
Dm          Bb        F     C
  When it's not worth dying for?
Dm        Bb        F       C

        Bb                 C
And you feel yourself suffocating?
 
Dm         Bb         F       C
  Does the pain weigh out the pride?
Dm        Bb         F        C
  And you look for a place to hide?
Dm        Bb             F       C
  Did someone break your heart inside?

You're in ruins

[Verse 2]
Dm            Bb     F          C
  When you're at the end of the road
Dm        Bb       F           C
  And you lost all sense of control
Dm         Bb            F           C
  And your thoughts have taken their toll
          Bb                             C
When your mind breaks the spirit of your soul
 
Dm     Bb             F      C
  Your faith walks on broken glass
Dm        Bb       F       C
  And the hangover doesn't pass
Dm          Bb   F        C

[Bridge]
Dm        Bb     F            C
  Did you try to live on your own
Dm         Bb              F         A
  When you burned down the house and home?
Dm         Bb       F            A
  Did you stand too close to the fire?
        Bb                 C
Like a liar looking for forgiveness from a stone

[Verse 1]
    C               Em
And now, the end is near,
         Gm              A7
And so I face, the final curtain.
   Dm                 Dm7
My   friend, I'll say it clear,
              G7                 C
I'll state my case, of which I'm certain.
 
 
[Verse 2]
      C                   C7
I've lived, a life that's full,
              F               Fm
I've traveled each, and every highway.
    C                    G7
And more, much more than this,
         F  C
I did it my way.
 
 
[Verse 3]
   C                Em
Regrets, I've had a few,
         Gm                A7
But then again, too few to mention.
  Dm             Dm7
I did, what I had to do,
           G7                 C
And saw it through, without exemption.
 
 
[Verse 4]
  C                         C7
I planned, each chartered course,
             F               Fm
Each careful step, along the byway.
    C                    G7
And more, much more than this,
         F    C
I did it   my way.
 
 
[Verse 5]
                   C                 C7
Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew,
       F
When I bit off, more than I could chew.
               Dm                  G7
But through it all, when there was doubt,
         Em7             Am
I ate it up, and spit it out.
           Dm               G7
I faced it all, and I stood tall,
           F  C
And did it my way.
 
 
[Verse 6]
C                            Em
I've loved, I've laughed and cried,
            Gm                A7
I've had my fill, my share of    losing.
    Dm          Dm7
And now, as tears subside,
          G7      C
I find it all so amusing.
 
 
[Verse 7]
C                   C7
To think, I did all that,
          F             Fm
And may I say, not in a shy way.
    C          G7
Oh, no, oh, no not me,
         F  C
I did it my way.
 
 
[Verse 8]
              C                 C7
For what is a man? What has he got?
          F
If not himself, then he has naught.
           Dm               G7
To say the things, he truly feels,
           Em7                 Am
And not the words, of one who kneels.
           Dm                G7
The record shows, I took the blows,
N.C.       F  C
And did it my way.

C  C/B  Am
 
[Outro]
G              C
 Yes it was my way

Where ever you will be
   G           F
So too shall I be
 
 
[Chorus]
 
                C
Close your eyes
                G
Dry your tears
             Dm         Am
'Coz when nothing seems clear
G               C
You'll be safe here
               G
From the sheer weight
        Dm
Of your doubts and fears
      Am
Weary heart
G                  F
You'll be safe here
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
Dm
Remember how we laughed
      Am        G
Until we cried
Dm
At the most stupid things
        Am      G
Like we were so high
Dm                            Am G
But love was all that we were on
         F
We belong
 
Dm
And though the world would
      Am         G
Never understand
Dm
This unlikely union
    Am            G
And why it still stands
Dm                     Am   G
Someday we will be set free
        F
Pray and believe
 
 
[Chorus]
 
           C             G
When the light disappears
                Dm           Am
And when this world's insincere
G                  C
You'll be safe here
G                 Dm
When nobody hears you scream
    Am
I'll scream with you
G                  C
You'll be safe here
 
 
[Interlude]
 
C - G - Dm - Am - G - F
 
 
[Chorus]
 
          C
Save your eyes
          G
From your tears
           Dm       Am
When everything's unclear
G              C
You'll be safe here
               G
From the sheer weight
         Dm
Of your doubts and fears
        Am     G
Wounded heart
 
            C        G
When the light disappears
               Dm           Am

You'll be safe here
 
       G
In my arms
             Dm
Through the long cold night
      Am
Sleep tight
G              C
You'll be safe here
 
         G         Dm
When no one understands
     Am
I'll believe
G
You'll be safe,
C
You'll be safe
G              Am           C
You'll be safe here, oohhh

Put your heart in my hands

You'll be safe here

[Verse 1]
 
     Am       G
On a cobweb afternoon
     Em7          F
In a room full of emptiness
     Am      G
By a freeway I confess
   Em7            F
I was lost in the pages
Am        G
Of a book full of death
Em7            F
Reading how we die alone
Am                      G
And if we're good we'll lay to rest
Em7            F
   Anywhere we wanna go

I'll wait for you there

[Verse 2]
 
      Am       G
On my deathbed I will pray
   Em7              F
To the gods and the angels
       Am     G
To the pagans or anyone
    Em7             F
Who will take me to heaven
Am         G
To a place I recall
Em7            F
I was there so long ago
    Am
The sky was bruised
    G
The wine was bled
    Em7              F
And there you led me on

For all the things I've done

In dreams until my death

I wander on

Am     Em     G     D7
(official music video only has Am and Em)
 
 
[Verse 1]
 
      Am
I was perched outside in the pouring rain
Em
Trying to make myself a sail
          G
Then I'll float to you my darlin'
         D7
With the evening on my tail
                 Am
Although not the most honest means of travel
   Em
It gets me there nonetheless
      G
I'm a heartless man at worst, babe
      D7
And a helpless one at best
 
 
[Chorus]
 
              Am
Darling, I'll bathe your skin
          Em
I'll even wash your clothes
             G                   D7
Just give me some candy, before I go
                 Am
Oh darling, I'll kiss your eyes
                 Em
And lay you down on your rug
             G
Just give me some candy
        D7
After my hug
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
           Am
Oh, and I'm often false explaining
Em
But to her it plays out all the same
          G
and although I'm left defeated
        D7
It gets held against my name
                 Am
I know you got plenty to offer, baby
   Em
But I guess I've taken quite enough
       G
Well, I'm some stain there on your bedsheet
      D7
You're my diamond in the rough
 
 
[Chorus]
 
              Am
Darling, I'll bathe your skin

I'll even wash your clothes

But darling, I'll bathe your skin

I'll even wash your clothes

All of them have got me waiting and waiting

Have got me on the fence just waiting and waiting

All they do is keep me waiting and waiting

Dragged a comb across my head

Found my way downstairs and drank a cup

Found my coat and grabbed my hat

Made the bus in seconds flat

[Verse 1]
Am                           E7
   On a dark desert highway,    cool wind in my hair
G                       D
  Warm smell of colitas   rising up through the air
F                           C
  Up ahead in the distance,   I saw a shimmering light
Dm
   My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim,
E
  I had to stop for the night

Am                                 E7
   There she stood in the doorway,    I heard the mission bell
G

              D
This could be heaven or this could be hell
F                           C
  Then she lit up a candle,   and she showed me the way
Dm
   There were voices down the corridor,
E7
   I thought I heard them say...

F                         C
 Welcome to the Hotel California

Such a lovely place (such a lovely place), such a lovely face

There's plenty of room at the Hotel California

Any time of year, (any time of year) You can find it here...
 
[Verse 3]
Am                              E7
   Her mind is Tiffany twisted,    She got the Mercedes bends
G                                     D
  She got a lot of pretty pretty boys   that she calls friends
F                                   C
  How they danced in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat
Dm                         E7
   Some dance to remember,    some dance to forget
 
[Verse 4]
Am                              E7
   So I called up the captain; ""Please bring me my wine"" (he said)
G                                        D
  ""We haven't had that spirit here since   1969""
F                                         C
  And still those voices are calling from far away
Dm
   Wake you up in the middle of the night
E7
   Just to hear them say...
 
[Chorus]
F                         C
 Welcome to the Hotel California
       E7                                         Am
Such a lovely place (such a lovely place), such a lovely face
        F                             C
They're livin' it up at the Hotel California
       Dm                                               E7
What a nice surprise (what a nice surprise), bring your alibis
 
[Verse 5]
Am*                        E7*
   Mirrors on the ceiling,    the pink champagne on ice (and she said)
G*                                D*
  We are all just prisoners here,   of our own device
F*                              C*
  And in the master's chambers,   they gathered for the feast
Dm*
   They stab it with their steely knives, but they
E7**
Just can't kill the beast
 
[Verse 6]
Am                              E7
   Last thing I remember, I was    running for the door
G                                       D
  I had to find the passage back to the place I was before
F                                     C
  ""Relax"" said the night man, ""we are   programmed to receive,
Dm
   You can check out any time you like
E7
   But you can never leave""

[Verse 2]
   G                              D
Hindi ko alam kung saan ko sisimulan (Sisimulan)
 Em
Binibigyang kulay ang larawan na para bang…
  G                                                 D     Em

[Verse 1]
C
   I'm so glad you made time to see me
Am
   How's life, tell me, how's your family
F                            C   G
   I haven't seen them in a while
C
   You've been good, busier than ever
Am
   We small talk, work and the weather
F                               C  G
   Your guard is up and I know why
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
Am                    G
Because the last time  you saw me
         C                          F
Is still burned in the back of your mind
            Am          G                   F
You gave me roses and I left them there to die
 
 
[Chorus]
   C                                           Em
So this is me swallowing my pride, standing in front of you
                           F
Saying I'm sorry for that night
         C                 G
And I go back to December all the time
   C
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Em                                    F
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
     C                  G                       F
I go back to December, turn around and make it alright
     Am               G
I go back to December all the time
 
| C     | Am  F  | x2
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
C
  These days I haven't been sleeping
Am
Staying up, playing back myself leaving
F                                         C   G
  When your birthday passed and I didn't call
       C
Then I think about summer, all the beautiful times
  Am
I watched you laughing from the passenger side
    F                              C   G
And   realized I loved you in the fall
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
 
Am                        G
   And then the cold came, the dark days
     C                  F
When fear crept into my mind
            Am
You gave me all your love
          G            F
and all I gave you was   goodbye
 
 
[Chorus]
   C                                           Em
So this is me swallowing my pride, standing in front of you

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
            Am                F
I miss your tan skin and your sweet smile
   C              G
So good to me, so right
             Am              F                   C
And how you held me in your arms that September night
                   G            Am
The first time you ever saw me cry
 
Maybe this is wishful thinking
F
   Probably mindless dreaming
C                                             G
  But if we loved again, I swear I'd love you right
 
       Am                 G               F
I'd go back in time and change it, but I can't
          Am                G          F
So if the chain is on your door, I understand
 
 
[Chorus]

It's just another night, and I'm staring at the Moon,
G                          D
I saw a shooting star and thought of you.
Cadd9           G       Em D  Cadd9
I sang a lullaby by the waterside and knew,

If you were here I'd sing to you.
Cadd9                  G        Em  D   Cadd9

Back to the time you were lying next to me,
G                    D
I looked across and fell in love.
Cadd9              G             Em    D  Cadd9
So I took your hand back through lamp lit streets I knew,

Everything led back to you.

Cmaj7          G*
You got a fast car
Em7                 Dadd11
I got a plan to get us out of here:
Cmaj7           G*
I been working at the convenience store,
Em7                 Dadd11
Managed to save just a little bit of money.
Cmaj7          G*
Wont't have to drive too far
Em7                 Dadd11
Just across the border and into the city,
Cmaj7          G*
You and I can both get jobs
Em7                 Dadd11
And finally see what it means to be living.

[Verse 3]
Cmaj7          G*
You see my old man's got a problem:
Em7                 Dadd11
He live with the bottle, that's the way it is.
Cmaj7          G*
He says his body's too old for working,
Em7                 Dadd11
His body's too young to look like his.
Cmaj7          G*
My mama went off and left him,
Em7                     Dadd11
she wanted more from life than he could give,
Cmaj7               G*
I said, ""Somebody's got to take care of him.""
Em7                Dadd11
So I quit school and that's what I did.
 
[Instrumental]
Cmaj7  G*  Em7  Dadd11  x2
 
[Verse 4]
Cmaj7  G*
You got a fast car
Em7  Dadd11
But is it fast enough so we can fly away?
Cmaj7  G*
We gotta make a decision:
Em7  Dadd11
Leave tonight or live and die this way.
 
[Instrumental]
Cmaj7  G*  Em7  Dadd11  Cmaj7  G*
 
[Chorus]
Em    Dadd11              C
 I remember when we were driving, driving in your car,
     G
The speed so fast I felt like I was drunk,
Em7
  City lights lay out before us
          D
And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder.
    C   Em7      D
And I_____ had a feeling that I belonged
    C   Em7      D                           C         D
And I_____ had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone.

[Verse 5]
Cmaj7  G*
You got a fast car
 Em7  Dadd11
And we go cruising to entertain ourelves;
Cmaj7  G*
You still ain't got a job
 Em7  Dadd11
And I work in a market as a checkout girl.
Cmaj7  G*
I know things will get better:
 Em7  Dadd11
You'll find work and I'll get promoted,
Cmaj7  G*
We'll move out of the shelter
 Em7  Dadd11
Buy a bigger house and live in the suburbs.
 
[Instrumental]
Cmaj7  G*  Em7  Dadd11  Cmaj7  G*
 
[Chorus]

[Instrumental]
Cmaj7  G*  Em7  Dadd11  x2
 
[Verse 6]
Cmaj7  G*
You got a fast car
Em7  Dadd11
And I got a job that pays all our bills.
Cmaj7  G*
You stay out drinking late at the bar,
Em7  Dadd11
See more your friends than you do your kids.
Cmaj7  G*
I'd always hoped for better,
Em7  Dadd11
Thought maybe together you and me would find it,
Cmaj7  G*
I got no plans, I ain't going nowhere,
Em7  Dadd11
so take your fast car and keep on driving.

In Taylor's acoustic version she plays her G as
Gsus2 [300033], and the Cadd9 as Csus2 [x30033].
I'm NOT changing the chord names throughout because
playing what I have sounds the same, whether
playing along with her live version or the CD
track.  Link to her live acoustic version -

          *******IMPORTANT NOTE ;)*******
THE CHORDS IN THE CHORUS WITH THE *'S ARE JUST ONE STRUM
OR BEAT AND THEN RIGHT INTO THE NEXT CHORD!  IT'S TRICKY!
PLAY ALONG WITH THE SONG TO GET THE TIMING DOWN. AFTER
A FEW TRIES ALONG WITH THE SONG, YOU'LL BE A PRO!!
 
Thanks to UG member Calc1o for nicely pointing out a
missing Dsus4 in the chorus :)

N.C.   A
As you promised me that I was more than all the miles combined

You must have had yourself a change of heart like halfway through the drive
                 F#m
'Cause your voice trailed off exactly as you passed my exit sign

Kept on driving straight and left our future to the right

Now I am stuck between my anger and the blame that I can't face

That I could cancel out the darkness I inherited from dad

[Verse 1: Sierra]
 
              Am
Little do you know
        F                  C     G
How I'm breaking while you fall asleep
              Am
Little do you know
          F              C   G
I'm still haunted by the memories
              Am
Little do you know
              F              C        G
I'm trying to pick myself up piece by piece
              F                    G      Gsus4
Little do you know I need a little more time
 
 
[Pre-Chorus: Sierra]
 
G             Am            F              C      G
Underneath it all, I'm held captive by the hole inside
                  Am           F                   C           G
I've been holding back for the fear that you might change your mind
                Am              F            C      G
I'm ready to forgive you but forgetting is a harder fight
              F                    G      Gsus4
Little do you know I need a little more time
 
 
[Chorus: Alex]
 
     C
I'll wait, I'll wait
  F
I love you like you've never felt
    C
The pain, I'll wait
  F                             C
I promise you don't have to be afraid, I'll wait
    F                                Am  Gsus4 F    C   F
The love is here and here to stay so lay your  head on me
 
 
[Verse 2: Alex]
 
              Am
Little do you know
              F                 C       G
I know you're hurtin' while I'm sound asleep
              Am
Little do you know
         F                 C         G
All my mistakes are slowly drowning me
              Am
Little do you know
              F              C            G
I'm trying to make it better piece by piece
              F                           G     Gsus4
Little do you know I, I love you till the sun dies
 
 
[Chorus: Alex & Sierra]

Oh wait, just wait

I love you like I've never felt

Our love is here and here to stay so lay your  head on me
 
 
[Chorus: Alex & Sierra]

Well maybe I came on too strong

Am

Am
   And jumping in harder than
G
Ten thousand rocks on the lake

You’re a mystery

I have travelled the world and there’s no other girl like you, no one
            C
What’s your history?
                                    Am
Do you have a tendency to lead some people on?
         F            G
‘Cause I heard you do, mmm-mmm

Am

Don't know how much I can take

[Verse]
G               Gmaj7            C
City girls just seem to find out early,
Am                            D7
how to open doors with just a smile.
  G                Gmaj7             C
A rich old man and she won't have to worry;
       Am              C              G
she'll dress up all in lace and go in style.
 
G               Gmaj7              C
Late at night a big old house gets lonely;
        Am                           D7
I guess every form of refuge has its price.
       G                   Gmaj7             C
And it breaks her heart to think her love is only
      Am            C                G     C  D
Given to a man with hands as cold as ice.
 
       G                  Gmaj7          C
So she tells him she must go out for the evening
   Am                                  D7
To comfort an old friend who's feeling down.
    G                    Gmaj7          C
But he knows where she's goin' as she's leavin';
      Am             C                G
She's headed for the cheatin' side of town.
 
[Chorus]
          G    C/D            G     C  G           Em    Bm               Am      D
You can't hi - ide your lyin' eyes,       and your smi - ile is a thin disguise.
             G    F/G         C    A7        Am              D               G

[Verse]
       G             Gmaj7         C
On the other side of town a boy is waiting
     Am                                 D7
with fiery eyes and dreams no one could steal
    G                     Gmaj7        C
She drives on through the night, anticipating
       Am                 C               G      C  D
Cos he makes her feel the way she used to feel
 
    G             Gmaj7             C
She rushes to his arms, they fall together
    Am                            D7
She whispers that it's only for a while
    G                          Gmaj7          C
She swears that soon she'll be coming back forever
    Am             C                 G
She pulls away and leaves him with a smile

[Interlude]
(G) Gmaj7  C    Am  D7  G
 
[Verse]
G               Gmaj7           C
She gets up and pours herself a strong one
    Am                                D7
And stares out at the stars up in the sky.
 G                  Gmaj7      C
Another night, it's gonna be a long one;
    Am                  C                 G     C  D
She draws the shade and hangs her head to cry.
 
    G              Gmaj7         C
She wonders how it ever got this crazy
    Am                             D7
She thinks about a boy she knew in school
    G                Gmaj7            C
Did she get tired or did she just get lazy
      Am               C                 G
She's so far gone, she feels just like a fool
 
G              Gmaj7              C
My, oh my, you sure know how to arrange things;
    Am                           D7
You set it up so well, so carefully.
         G              Gmaj7           C
Ain't it funny how your new life didn't change things;
       Am                 C                G
You're still the same old girl you used to be.
 
[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
 
D
We were both young when I first saw you
  G
I close my eyes and the flashback starts
             Bm                    G
I'm standing there on a balcony in summer air
 
D
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
G
See you make your way through the crowd
           Bm
And say hello
           A
Little did I know
 
 
     G                        A
That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
       Bm                        D
And my daddy said stay away from Juliet
          G
And I was crying on the staircase
A                        Bm G    A
Begging you please don't go, and I said
 
 
[Chorus]
 
D
Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone
A
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
Bm
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
G                  A            N.C.  D
It's a love story, baby just say yes
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
   D
So I sneak out to the garden to see you
G
We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew
              Bm
So close your eyes
                       A
Escape this town for a little while oh
      G                       A
Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
 
 
       Bm                        D
And my daddy said stay away from Juliet
             G
But you were everything to me
      A                        Bm G    A
I was begging you please don't go, and I said
 
 
[Chorus]
 
D
Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone
A
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
Bm
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
G                 A
It's a love story baby just say yes
 
D
Romeo save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
A
This love is difficult, but it's real
Bm
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
G                 A                 (D)
It's a love story baby just say yes, oh - oh -oh
 
 
[Interlude]
 
D  A  Bm  G
 
 
[Bridge]
 
               Bm      G               D                     A
I got tired of waiting,   wondering if you were ever coming around
                   Bm  G
My faith in you was fading
       D                           A
When I met you on the outskirts of town and I said
 
 
[Chorus]
 
D
Romeo save me, I've been feeling so alone
A
I keep waiting for you but you never come
   Bm
Is this in my head, I don't know what to think
   G                       A
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said
 
 
E
Marry me Juliet, you'll never have to be alone
B
I love you and that's all I really know
  C#m
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
A                 B            E
It's a love story baby just say yes
   B       C#m
Oh-ooh, oh-oh, oh
      A                                   E
Cause we were both young when I first saw you

 Since you've been gone, I've been lost without a trace,
G
 I dream at night, I can only see your face,

 I look around but it's you I can't replace,

 I feel so cold and I long for your embrace,

I keep crying baby, baby please.

[Verse 1]
      C
I was distracted and in traffic
          Dm7
I didn't feel it when the earthquake happened

But it really got me thinkin', were you out drinkin'?

Were you in the livin' room, chillin' watchin' television?

If the world was ending you'd come over right?

The sky'd be falling and I'd hold you tight
                        C
And there wouldn't be a reason why
                      Am
We would even have to say goodbye

But it really got me thinkin', that night we went drinkin'

Stumbled in the house and didn't make it past the kitchen
                C
Ah, it's been a year now, think I've figured out how
                       Am
How to think about you without it rippin' my heart out

                               G
The sky'd be falling while I'd hold you tight
                        C
No, there wouldn't be a reason why
                      Am
We would even have to say goodbye
                                   F
If the world was ending you'd come over, right?
                      G                                                         C    Am
You'd come over, right? You'd come over, you'd come over, you'd come over, right?
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
Am       G         C      Em           F *
I know, you know, we know you weren't down for forever and it's fine
Am      G         C      Em          F   *
I know, you know, we know we weren't meant for each other and it's fine
 
 
[Chorus]
                                       F
But if the world was ending you'd come over, right?
                          G
You'd come over and you'd stay the night
                          C
Would you love me for the hell of it?
                         Am
All our fears would be irrelevant
                                   F
If the world was ending you'd come over, right?
                               G
The sky'd be falling while I'd hold you tight
                        C
No, there wouldn't be a reason why
                      Am
We would even have to say goodbye
                   F                             G
If the world was ending... you'd come over, right?
                                                        C
You'd come over, you'd come over, you'd come over, right?  Hmm

[Intro]
 
D D  Dsus2 Dsus2 D
 
[Chorus]
 
G        A               D               G
Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
        D                G               A
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to.
G        A               D               G
Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
       D             G                 A         D
In the jingle jangle morning I'll come following you.  
 
[Verse]
 
         G                  A          D             G
Though I know that evenings empire has returned into sand,
D                G
Vanished from my hand,
        D               G                   A
Left me blindly here to stand but still not sleeping.
   G          A             D             G
My weariness amazes me, I'm branded on my feet,
  D              G
I have no one to meet
        D             G                     A
And the ancient empty street's too dead for dreaming.
 
[Chorus]
 
G        A               D               G
Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
        D                G               A
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to.
G        A               D               G
Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
       D             G                 A         D
In the jingle jangle morning I'll come following you.
 
[Verse]
 
G            A              D              G
Take me on a trip upon your magic swirling ship,
   D                G            D                   G
My senses have been stripped, my hands can't feel to grip,
   D                G          D           G
My toes too numb to step, wait only for my boot heels
      A
To be wandering.
    G           A             D            G
I'm ready to go anywhere, I'm ready for to fade
  D           G               D                G
Into my own parade, cast your dancing spell my way,
                A
I promise to go under it.
 
[Chorus]
 
G        A               D               G
Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
        D                G               A
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to.
G        A               D               G
Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
       D             G                 A         D
In the jingle jangle morning I'll come following you.
 
[Verse]
 
           G                    A                  D                G
Though you might hear laughing, spinning, swinging madly across the sun,
         D           G                D             G
It's not aimed at anyone, it's just escaping on the run
        D                 G             A
And but for the sky there are no fences facing.
    G                 A         D                 G
And if you hear vague traces of skipping reels of rhyme
        D             G                 D              G
To your tambourine in time, it's just a ragged clown behind,
           D          G                 D
I wouldn't pay it any mind, it's just a shadow you're
G                A
Seeing that he's chasing.
 
[Chorus]
 
G        A               D               G
Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
        D                G               A
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to.
G        A               D               G
Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
       D             G                 A         D
In the jingle jangle morning I'll come following you.
 
[Bridge]
 
     G            A                   D                 G
Then take me disappearing through the smoke rings of my mind,
         D              G         D               G
Down the foggy ruins of time, far past the frozen leaves,
    D                   G          D            G
The haunted, frightened trees, out to the windy beach,
    D                G              A
Far from the twisted reach of crazy sorrow.
        G                 A                D               G
Yes, to dance beneath the diamond sky with one hand waving free,
    D              G            D             G
Silhouetted by the sea, circled by the circus sands,
         D          G           D                G
With all memory and fate driven deep beneath the waves,
          D         G             A
Let me forget about today until tomorrow.
 
[Chorus]
 
G        A               D               G
Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
        D                G               A
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to.
G        A               D               G
Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
       D             G                 A         D
In the jingle jangle morning I'll come following you.

When I find myself in times of trouble, Mother Mary comes to me

To be the one here talking to me

[Verse 1]
    Em G      D C
Hello,  it's me
       Em          G                D
I was wondering if after all these years
               C          Em  G       D  C
You'd like to meet, to go over everything
               Em                 G
They say that time's supposed to heal ya
             D         C
But I ain't done much healing
 
[Verse 2]
    Em G         D     C
Hello,  can you hear me?
        Em          G              D             C
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
              Em    G      D C
When we were younger and free
      Em               G               D                 C
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet
 
[Pre-Chorus]
                Em   D        Bm  C
There's such a difference between us
       Em  D   C
And a million miles
 
[Chorus]
 Em          C        G  D
Hello from the other side
   Em                C       G   D
I must've called a thousand times 
         Em      C                G              D
To tell you I'm sorry, for everything that I've done
            Em       C     G          D
But when I call you never seem to be home
 Em          C     G  D
Hello from the outside
    Em               C         G  D
At least I can say that I've tried 
         Em      C           G            D
To tell you I'm sorry, for breaking your heart
                 Em       C              G         D       Em G D C
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore
 
[Verse 3]
    Em G    D    C
Hello,  how are you?
         Em         G           D           C
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
   Em G             D  C
I hope that you're well
        Em           G                       D            C
Did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened?
 
[Pre-Chorus]
         Em   D          Bm     C       Em     D       C
It's no secret that the both of us are running out of time
 
[Chorus]
   Em         C          G  D
So hello from the other side
   Em                C       G   D
I must've called a thousand times

She lives with a broken man
Dmaj9/F#       E6        Dsus2

[Intro]
G   Bm   C   G
 
[Verse 1]
G
There I was again tonight
Bm
Forcing laughter, faking smiles
C                         G
Same old tired, lonely place
G
Walls of insincerity
Bm
Shifting eyes and vacancy
C                          G
Vanished when I saw your face
 
                     C                   Em   D
All I can say is, it was enchanting to meet you
 
 
[Verse 2]
G
Your eyes whispered 'have we met?'
Bm
Crossed the room, your silhouette
C                          G
Starts to make its way to me
    G
The playful conversation starts
Bm
Counter all your quick remarks
    C                       G
Like passing notes in secrecy
 
       C                   Em   D
And it was enchanting to meet you
                    C                  Em   D
All I can say is, I was enchanted to meet you
 
 
[Chorus]
C               G
  This night is sparkling
D                C
Don't you let it go
            G
I'm wonderstruck
         D             C
Blushing all the way home
              G    D                C
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
                     Em     D  G
I was enchanted to meet you-ou-ou
 
 
[Verse 3]
    G
The lingering question kept me up
Bm
2 AM, who do you love?
 C                       G
I wonder till I'm wide awake
    G
And now I'm pacing back and forth
Bm
Wishing you were at my door
  C                         G
I'd open up and you would say 'hey'
 
   C                   Em   D
It was enchanting to meet you
                C                  Em   D
All I know is I was enchanted to meet you

Blushing all the way home

Dancing around all alone
              G    D                C
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew

             This is me praying that
 
[Bridge]
C
  This was the very first page
Em              D
  Not where the storyline ends
C
  My thoughts will echo your name
Em        D
  Until I see you again
C                                Em        D
  These are the words I held back as I was leaving too soon
C                      Em   Dadd4/F#
  I was enchanted to meet you
 
G                             Bm
Please, don't be in love with someone else
C                           G
Please, don't have somebody waiting on you
G                             Bm

Dancing around all alone

I was enchanted to meet you

Please, don't have somebody waiting on you

G                   A7
Three little birds, sat on my window
C/D                                 G
And they told me I don't need to worry
G                     A7
Summer came like cinnamon, so sweet
C/D                                 G
Little girls double-dutch on the concrete
 
Em7     B7/D#          Em7                         A9
Maybe sometimes, we've got it wrong, but it's alright
     Cmaj7                               Cmmaj7
The more things seem to change, the more they stay the same
 
Oh, don't you hesitate
 
[Chorus]
G                          A7/E
Girl, put your records on, tell me your favourite song
C/D                       G
You go ahead, let your hair down
G                         A7/E
Sapphire and faded jeans, I hope you get your dreams,
C/D                        G
Just go ahead, let your hair down
Cmaj7                            Cmmaj7         G
     You're gonna find yourself somewhere, somehow
 
[Verse 2]
G                A7
Blue as the sky, sunburnt and lonely,
C/D                              G
Sipping tea in a bar by the roadside,
                   G
(just relax, just relax)
                           A7
Don't you let those other boys fool you,
C/D                        G
Got to love that afro hair do

C#m
   Now I can't sing a love song
         B
like the way it's meant to be
        A
Well, I guess I'm not that good anymore
    B                 A B
but baby, that's just me

[Verse 2]
 
         C#m
Now your pictures that you left behind
         B
are just memories of a different life
          A
Some that made us laugh, some that made us cry
         G#m                       B
One that made you have to say goodbye
 
         C#m
What I'd give to run my fingers through your hair,
   B
to touch your lips, to hold you near
         A
When you say your prayers try to understand
     G#m                A      B
I've made mistakes, I'm just a man
 
 
[Pre-chorus 2]
 
        C#m
When he holds you close, when he pulls you near
        B
when he says the words you've been needing to hear
          A
I'll wish I was him 'cause those words are mine
   B                   A      B
to say to you till the end of time
 
 
[Chorus]

And I will love you, baby

  If you told me to die for you

I would
       A           G
Take a look at my face
                         A
There's no price I won't pay

to say these words to you

Well, there ain't no luck in these loaded dice
    B
But baby if you give me just one more try
       A
we can pack up our old dreams and our old lives
      B
We'll find a place where the sun still shines

E
Who's to say
E
  What's impossible
     F#m
Well they forgot
F#m
  This world keeps spinning
         E
And with each new day
E                        F#m           F#m
  I can feel a change in everything
                            E             E
And as the surface breaks reflections fade

But in some ways they remain the same
                         E               E
And as my mind begins to spread its wings
                        F#m    F#m
There's no stopping curiosity
 
 
[Chorus]
                               E     F#m
I want to turn the whole thing upside down
A               B                    E       F#m
  I'll find the things they say just can't be found
A                 B                E    F#m
  I'll share this love I find with every-one
A                B               E       F#m
  We'll sing and dance to Mother Nature's songs

  I don't want this feeling to go away

Capo 4th fret
 
Cadd9* - play melody of G, F#, D over C
 
 
[Intro]
 
Cmaj7           Gmaj7/D           Cmaj7             Cadd9*
      Hey yay yay,      yah ha ha,      ay yeah, hi
 
 
[Verse 1]
 
   D/F# G   D/F#          Em
An old  man turned ninety-eight
     D/F#        G     D/F#          Em
He won the lottery and died the next day
     D/F#    G      D/F#         Em
It's a black fly in your Chardonnay
       D/F#      G          D/F#        Em
It's a death row pardon two minutes too late
             D/F#  G              D/F#  Em
And isn't it ironic ... don't you think
 
 
[Chorus]
 
             D  G          D       Em
It's like ra-aaiin on your wedding day
            D  G             D       Em
It's a free ride when you've already paid
                D G           D           Em
It's the good advice that you just didn't take
    F            C                 D
And who would've thought ... it figures
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
    D/F#        G      D/F#        Em
Mr. Play It Safe  was afraid to fly
              D/F# G                   D/F#       Em
He packed his suit-case and kissed his kids goodbye
              D/F#       G       D/F#      Em
He waited his whole damn life to take that flight
           D/F#          G
And as the plane crashed down he thought
       D/F#          Em
""Well, isn't this nice ...""
              D/F#  G             D/F#  Em
And isn't it ironic ... don't you think

It's a free ride when you've already paid

      Cmaj7                               Gmaj7/D
Well, life has a funny way of sneaking up on you when you think everything's okay
    Cmaj7                 Gmaj7/D
And everything's going right
    Cmaj7                                Gmaj7/D
And life has a funny way of helping you out when you think everything's gone wrong
    Cmaj7                         Cadd9*
And everything blows up in your face
 
 
[Verse 3]
 
  D/F#    G               D/F#        Em
A traffic jam when you're already late
     D/F#    G            D/F#      Em
A no-smoking sign on your cigarette break
          D/F#         G                   D/F#      Em
It's like ten thousand spoons when all you need is a knife
     D/F#                  G
It's meeting the man of my dreams
            D/F#               Em
And then meeting his beautiful wife ... hmm
 
              D/F#  G             D/F#  Em
And isn't it ironic ... don't you think
             D/F#   G               D/F#           Em
A little too ironic ... and yeah, I really do think ...
 
 
[Chorus]
 
             D  G         D       Em
It's like ra-aiin on your wedding day

Gm               Bb
   Slow down you crazy child

You're so ambitious for a juvenile
            Eb                      Bb
But then if you're so smart tell me why
                   C    D9sus4  D
Are you still so afraid
 
Gm                              Bb
   Where's the fire, what's the hurry about
          F                       Ab
You better cool it off before you burn it out

That you can get what you want
           Gm        Bb/F
Or you can just get old

Before your time

Although it's so romantic on the borderline tonight, tonight

   Too bad but it's the life you lead

You're so ahead of yourself

G                C                 C#dim      C
Hey now you're a Rock Star get the show on get paid 
    G        C           C#dim
And all that glitters is gold 
C             G     F         C
Only shooting stars break the mold 
 
[Verse 2]
       G                   D
It's a cool place and they say it gets colder 
       Am                       C
You're bundled up now but wait 'til you get older 
        G                 D
But the meteor men beg to differ 
               Am                    C
Judging by the hole in the satellite picture 
 
           G                       D
The ice we skate is getting pretty thin 
                   Am                        C
The waters getting warm so you might as well swim 
              G              D
My world's on fire how about yours 
                 Am                      C
That's the way I like it and I never get bored 
 
[Chorus]
G                 C                 C#dim      C
Hey now you're an All Star get your game on, go play 
G                C                 C#dim      C
Hey now you're a Rock Star get the show on get paid 
G        C           C#dim
all that glitters is gold 
C             G     F         C
Only shooting stars break the mold 
 
[Instrumental]
G  C  C#dim  C  x4
 
[Chorus]
G                 C                 C#dim      C
Hey now you're an All Star get your game on, go play 
G                C                 C#dim      C
Hey now you're a Rock Star get the show on get paid 
     G       C           C#dim
And all that glitters is gold 
C             G    F
Only shooting stars
 
[Verse 3]
    G         D              Am                    C
Somebody once asked, could I spare some change for gas 
          G           D             Am    C
I need to get myself away from this place
       G             D            Am                  C
I said yep what a concept I could use a little fuel myself 
             G         D      Am       C
And we could all use a little change 
 
         G                           D
Well the years start coming and they don't stop coming 
Am                     C
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running 
G                        D
Didn't make sense not to live for fun 
     Am                        C
Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb 
 
G             D
So much to do so much to see 
          Am                    C
So what's wrong with taking the back streets 
       G                       D
You'll never know if you don't go, go 
       Am                       C
You'll never shine if you don't glow 
 
[Chorus]
G                 C                 C#dim      C
Hey now you're an All Star get your game on, go play 
G                C                 C#dim      C
Hey now you're a Rock Star get the show on get paid 
    G        C           C#dim
And all that glitters is gold 
C             G     F         C
Only shooting stars break the mold 
    G        C           C#dim
And all that glitters is gold 
C             G     F         C
Only shooting stars break the mold

A
(Take me back, take me back)
 
(Oh yeah)
Bm                        G
(Back to summer paradise)
 
 
[Verse 1]
 
   D
My heart is sinking
A              Bm
As I'm lifting up
                           G
Above the clouds away from you
 
      D                 A
And I can't believe I'm leaving
     Bm                                G
Oh I don't kno-kno-know what I'm gonna do
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
 
   Bm     G
But someday
D              A
I will find my way back
        Bm     G
To where your name
    F#7
Is written in the sand
 
 
[Chorus]
 
G                       D
Cause I remember every sunset
A                Bm      A  G
I remember every word you said
                        D        A
And we were never gonna say goodbye
 
Singin' ""la-da-ta-ta-ta""
 
G                  D
Tell me how to get back to
A                 Bm      A   G
Back to summer paradise with you
A                      G         D
And I'll be there in a heartbeat
  A
Oh-oh
  A                  G        D
I'll be there in a heartbeat
  A
Oh-oh
 
(Tell 'em)
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
   D
My soul is broken
A
Streets are frozen
Bm                                  G
I can't stop these feelings melting through
 
    D               A
And I'd give away a thousand days, oh
Bm                            G
Just to have another one with you
 
(What'd you say)
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
 
                    D
Where real life can wait
(Real life can wait)
                    A
We're crashing like waves
(Uh-huh)
                     Bm
We're playin' in the sand
(Me and you)
             F#7
Holding your hand
 
 
[Chorus]
 
G                       D
Cause I remember every sunset
A                Bm     A  G
I remember every word you said
                        D        A
And we were never gonna say goodbye
 
Singin' ""la-da-ta-ta-ta""
 
G                  D
Tell me how to get back to
A                  Bm     A   G
Back to summer paradise with you
A                      G         D
And I'll be there in a heartbeat
A
Oh-oh
  A                 G         D
I'll be there in a heartbeat
A
Oh-oh 
 
 
[Verse 3]
 
(Yeah - Oh)
 
       D
I remember summer mornings
And summer evenings
 A
Now you're right next to me
And I am freezing
 Bm
Was it real?
Oh baby tell me, was I dreaming?
 G
How can you show me paradise,
When I'm leaving?
 
         D
Now my heartbeat is sinking
Hope is shrinking
 A
When I try to speak no words
Lip-syncing
 Bm
Hope this is not just wishful thinking
 G
Tell me that you care
And I'll be there in a heartbeat
 
Bm   G
Someday
D              A
I will find my way back
         Bm     G
To where your name
    F#7
Is written in the sand
 
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, let's go)
 
 
[Chorus]
 
G                       D
Cause I remember every sunset
A                Bm     A   G
I remember every word you said
                    D        A
We were never gonna say goodbye
 
Singin' ""la-da-ta-ta-ta""
 
G                  D
Tell me how to get back to
A                 Bm      A   G
Back to summer paradise with you
A
(And I'll be there in a heartbeat)
G                  D
I remember when we first kissed
    A                   Bm      A   G
And how I didn't wanna leave your lips
                         D       A
And how I've never ever felt so high
 
Singin' ""la-da-ta-ta-ta""
 
   G                  D
So tell me how to get back to
A               Bm         A   G
Back to summer paradise with you
A                     G         D
And I'll be there in a heartbeat
A
Oh-oh
A                  G        D
I'll be there in a heartbeat
(Summer paradise)
A
Oh-oh
                   G
I'll be there in a heartbeat

  We could leave the Christmas lights up 'til January
G             D                  C
  This is our place, we make the rules
              G                  D             C
And there's a dazzling haze, a mysterious way about you, dear

  Have I known you 20 seconds or 20 years?

And decided to create a dream come true

So they sprinkled moondust in your hair of gold

And starlight in your eyes of blue

No, So you’re walkin’ out the door

Nobody told me you’ve been cryin’

Nobody told me you’d been dyin’

But didn’t want to fight

Nobody told me that you fell out of love from me

So I’m settin’ you free

Let me be the one to break it up

So you won’t have to make excuses
          D                   C#m
We don’t need to find a set up where
         Bm              A
Someone wins and someone loses
         D               C#
We just have to say our love was true

Just turn around and walk away

You don’t have to live like this... Ohhhh

If you love me still then stay

Don’t keep me waiting for that final kiss
        F#m           C#m
We can work together through this test
         D                C#m
Or we can work through it apart
      C                F
I just need to get this off my chest
             Bm               E
That you will always have my heart
 
 
[Chorus]

Let me be the one to break it up

[Verse 1]
 
F#m                                       A
Ticking away the moments that make up a dull day
E                                          F#m
Fritter and waste the hours in an offhand way
F#m                                         A
Kicking around on a piece of ground in your hometown
E                                                 F#m
Waiting for someone or something to show you the way
 
 
[Chorus]
 
Dmaj7                           Amaj7
Tired of lying in the sunshine, staying home to watch the rain
Dmaj7                               Amaj7
You are young and life is long, and there is time to kill today
Dmaj7                          C#m7
     And then one day you find,   ten years have got behind you
Bm7                           E
No one told you when to run ... You missed the starting gun

         F#m                                                A
And you run and you run to catch up with the Sun, but it's sinking;
E                                     F#m
Racing around to come up behind you again.
    F#m                                            A
The Sun is the same in a relative way, but you're older,
E                                         F#m
shorter of breath, and one day closer to death.
 
Dmaj7                          Amaj7
Every year is getting shorter, never seem to find the time.
Dmaj7                                Amaj7
Plans that either come to naught, or half a page of scribbled lines.
Dmaj7                     C#m7
Hanging on in quiet desperation is the English way.
    Bm                              Bm7                   F/B
The time is gone, the song is over. Thought I'd something more to say.

Em7            A7
  Home, home again
Em7                      A7
I like to be here when I can
Em7                          A7
  When I come home, cold and tired
     Em7                               A7
It's good to warm my bones beside the fire
Cmaj7
Far away, across the field
Bm7
Tolling on the iron bell
Fmaj7
Calls the faithful to their knees
G                  D7#9   D7b9  Bm
To hear the softly spoken magic spell

                           A
Well, there's so much they hold
                   G   D
And just like them old stars
                  G       D
I see that you've come so far
                  G   D
To be right where you are
    Bm          A
How old is your soul?
 
[Chorus]
                   G     D
Well, I won't give up on us
            Bm        A
Even if the skies get rough
               G      D
I'm giving you all my love
                  A
I'm still looking up
 
[Verse 2]
                        G    D
And when you're needing your space
           G    D
To do some navigaaating
             G         D
I'll be here patiently waiting
   Bm           A
To see what you find
 
[Chorus]
                G          D
'Cause even the stars they burn
          Bm          A
Some even fall to the earth
         G      D
We got a lot to learn
                A
God knows we're worth it

No, I won't give up

I don't wanna be someone who walks away so easily
                                              Asus2
I'm here to stay and make the difference that I can make
    Em
Our differences they do a lot to teach us how to use
                                              Asus2
The tools and gifts we got, yeah, we got a lot at stake
           C
And in the end, you're still my friend, at least we did intend
                                               C#dim
For us to work, we didn't break, we didn't burn
 
We had to learn how to bend without the world caving in
C                        C#dim
I had to learn what I got, and what I'm not
          D
And who I am
 
[Chorus]
             G     D
I won't give up on us
            Bm        A
Even if the skies get rough
               G      D
I'm giving you all my love
                  Bm7               A
I'm still looking up (Still looking up)
 
                   G     D
Well, I won't give up on us
              Bm     A
God knows I'm tough enough
         G      D
We got a lot to learn
                A
God knows we're worth it.
 
             G     D
I won't give up on us
            Bm        A
Even if the skies get rough
               G      D
I'm giving you all my love
                  A
I'm still looking up

A              Em                  D             A  Asus2 A
Just yesterday morning they let me know you were gone 
            E                      G
Suzanne the plans they made put an end to you 
  A               Em            D               A  Asus2 A
I walked out this morning and I wrote down this song

I just can't remember who to send it to

I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend

Won't you look down upon me, Jesus 
              D              A  Asus2 A
You've got to help me make a stand

You've just got to see me through another day

 My body's aching and my time is at hand

And I won't make it any other way

Been walking my mind to an easy time, my back turned towards the sun 
                    E                     G
Lord knows when the cold wind blows it'll turn your head around

Well, there's hours of time on the telephone line to talk about things to come 
                 E                  G                    G D
Sweet dreams and flying machines in pieces on the ground

There's just a few things coming my way this time around, now 
            G                    Em               A
Thought I'd see you, thought I'd see you fire and rain, now . . .

Capo 4
 
 
[Verse 1]
Em                                      C
  I look up from the ground to see your sad and teary eyes
          G                             Bm
You look away from me and I see there's something you're trying to hide
     Em                                C
And I reach for your hand but it's cold you pull away again
      G                     Bm
And I wonder what's on your mind
 
 
[Pre-chorus 1]
C                            Em
  And then you say to me you made a dumb mistake
D                               D
  You start to tremble and your voice begins to break
            C                                      Em
You say the cigarettes on the counter weren't your friend’s, They were my mate’s
      D                                D
And I feel the colour draining from my face
 
 
[Chorus]
 
And my friend said
Em                               C
  ""I know you love her, but it's over, mate
G                            D
  It doesn't matter, put the phone away
Em                   C
  It's never easy to walk away,
        G          D
let her go oh oh oh
 
It'll be alright""
 
 
[Verse 2]
Em                              C
So I still look back at all the messages you'd sent
      G                                Bm
And I know it wasn't right, but it was fucking with my head
Em                                C
  And everything deleted like the past yea it was gone
    G                                 Bm
And when I touched your face, I could tell you're moving on
 
 
[Pre-chorus 2]
C                                Em
  But it's not the fact that you kissed him yesterday
         D                           D
It's the feeling of betrayal, that I just can't seem to shake
    C                               Em
And everything I know tells me that I should walk away
      D            D
But I just want to stay
 
 
[Chorus]
 
And my friend said
Em                               C
  ""I know you love her, but it's over, mate
G                            D
  It doesn't matter, put the phone away
Em                   C
  It's never easy to walk away,
        G          D
Let her go oh oh oh
 
It'll be okay
 
Em                      C
  It's gonna hurt for a bit of time
G                         D
  So bottoms up, let's forget tonight
Em                               C
  You'll find another and you'll be just fine
        G          D
Let her go oh oh oh
 
 
[Bridge]
    Em        C
But nothing heals
    G           D
the past like time
    Em           C
And they can't steal
    G                     D
The love you're born to find
    Em        C
But nothing heals
    G           D
the past like time
    Em           C
And they can't steal

  You'll find another and you'll be just fine

Let her go oh oh oh""
 
 
[Outro]
           Em         C
It’ll be alright
           G          D
It’ll be alright

It’ll be alright

It’ll be alright

[Verse 1]
 
    Em                      C
    Come to decide that the things that I tried
         G               D
    Were in my life just to get high on.
Em                    C
    When I sit alone, come, get a little known,
    G                      D
    But I need more than myself this time.
    Em                        C
    Step from the road to the sea to the sky,
          G               D
    And I do believe that we rely on.
Em                   C                         G                D
    When I lay it on, come, get to play it on, all my life to sacrifice.

    Em                      C
    When will I know that I really can’t go
           G                    D
    To the well once more, time to decide on.
Em                        C
    When it’s killing me, when will really see,
    G                  D
    All that I need to look inside?
    Em                     C
    Come to believe that I better not leave,
      G             D
    Before I get my chance to ride.
Em                        C

Deep beneath the cover of another perfect wonder,
           Am
Where it’s so white as snow.
G                      D
Privately divided by a world so undecided,
            Am
And there’s nowhere to go.
G                        D
In between the cover of another perfect wonder,

Where it’s so white as snow.
G                                      D
Running through the field where all my tracks will be concealed,

    All the channels that have broken down.
Em                       C

I'm going back to 505 If it's a 7 hour flight

Or a forty-five minute drive
   Em                             Dm
In my imagination you're waiting lying on your side
           Em                       Dm Em
With your hands between your thighs
 
[Verse 1]

Stop and wait a sec when you look at me like that
           Dm                     Em
My darling what did you expect? I probably still adore you

I'm not shy of a spark 
    Em                                        Dm
The knife twists at the thought that I should fall short of the mark
Em                                    Dm
Frightened by the bite though it's no harsher than the bark
     Em                          Dm                      Em
The middle of adventure, such a perfect place to start

 And I'm a house of cards

I, I just woke up from a dream
                               Amaj7
Where you and I had to say goodbye
                             Dmaj7
And I don't know what it all means

[Verse 1]
Bm           G
  Ridin' high, when I was king
C#m7                   F#7
  I played it hard and fast, 'cause I had everything
Bm             G
  I walked away, you want me then
C#m7                F#7
  But easy come and easy go and it would end

So, any time I need ya, let me go

Like a heart in the best way should

You can give it away, you had it and you took the pay

But I keep walkin' on

Keep opening doors
 
Keep hoping for

Em          D
Blue jeans, White shirt
A
Walked into the room you know you made my eyes burn
             Em          D
It was like, James Dean, for sure
A
You so fresh to death and sick as ca-cancer
Em                        D
You were sorta punk rock, I grew up on hip hop
    A
But you fit me better than my favourite sweater, and I know
Em                D
That love is mean, and love hurts
    A
But I still remember that day we met in December, oh baby!
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
Em              D               A
I will love you till the end of time
 A                      Em
I would wait a million years
Em              D                   A
Promise you'll remember that you're mine

Baby can you see through the tears

Love you more, than those bitches before

Say you'll remember, oh baby, say you'll remember

[Verse 3]
 
Em          D
Big dreams, Gangster
A
Said you had to leave to start your life over
             Em          D
I was like: ""No please"", ""Stay here""
A
""We don't need no money we can make it all work""
Em                        D
But he headed out on Sunday, said he'd come home Monday
    A
I stayed up waiting, anticipating and pacing but he was
Em                D
Chasing, Paper
    A
""Caught up in the game"" that was the last I heard

He went out every night, And baby that's alright
                                                      D
I told you that no matter what you did, I'd be by your side
 D
Cause I'm a ride or die, Whether you fail or fly,
 D
Well shit at least you tried.
                             Em
But when you walked out that door, a piece of me died
Em
I told you I wanted more, but that not what I had in mind
                    D
I just want it like before, We were dancing all night
 D
Then they took you away, - stole you out of my life
 D
You just need to remember...

    D               Dmaj7
And now, the end is near,
         D7            B7
And so I face the final curtain,
    Em7                Em7/D
My friend. I'll say it clear,
             Em7/C#   A7       D
I'll state my case of which I'm certain.
     D                   D7
I've lived a life that's full.

I traveled each and every highway,

And more, much more than this, I did it m      y way.

    D               Dmaj7
Regrets, I've had a few,
         D7                B7
But then again, too few to mention.
  Em7               Em7/D
I did what I had to do,
           Em7/C#   A7    D
And saw it thru without exemption.
  D                    D7
I planned each charted course,
             G              Gm
Each careful step along the byway,
    D                    A     Asus4    G        D
And more, much more than this, I did it m      y way.
 
 
[Verse 3]
               D                   D7
Yes there were times, I'm sure you knew,
           G                     Gsus4 G
When I bit off more than I could chew,
            Em               A7
But thru it all, when there was doubt,
         F#m               Bm7
I ate it up, and spit it out.
           Em               A
I faced it all, and I stood tall,
   Asus4    G       D
And did it m      y way.
 
 
[Verse 4]
    D               Dmaj7
I've loved, I've laughed and cried.
         D7                B7
I've had my fill; my share of losing.
  Em7               Em7/D
And now, as tears subside,
           Em7/C#   A7    D
I find it all so  amusing.
  D                    D7
To think I did all that;
             G              Gm
And may I say - not in a shy way,
    D   A       Asus4        G    D
""No, oh no not me, I did it m   y way"".
 
 
[Verse 5]
               D               D7
For what is a man, what has he got?
              G
If not himself, then he has naught.
         Em7               A7
To say the things he truly feels;  
           F#m                Bm7
And not the words of one who kneels.
           Em7               A         Asus4    G      D
The record shows I took the blows - And did it m   y way!
 
 
Author notes:
Starting at the A before my--way, play 002220 ""and"", 002230 ""did"", 002250 ""it"",
then pick the G as 3xx000 ""m....y"", before stepping back to D 2xxxxx 0xxxxx 000232 ""way""
 
If you prefer, you can play 022030 and 022020 for Em7/D and Em7/C#.
Those Em sound slightly better on the 7th if you've got long fingers: Em 779917, Em7/D x5991x, Em7/C# x4991x

G               Gm
Schoolbag in hand
            D           F#m
She leaves home in the early morning
G       Gm
Waving goodbye
        D               F#m
With an absent-minded smile
G           Gm
I watch her go
        D               F#m
With a surge of that well-known sadness
G               A               D
And I have to sit down for a while
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
 
    G                A/C#          D       F#
The feeling that I'm losing her forever
    G              A            D        D/F#
And without really entering her world
    G              A/C#           D              Asus4         Dsus4   D
I'm glad whenever I can share her laughter, that funny little girl
 
 
[Chorus]
 
                      G             D
Slipping through my fingers all the time
          F#m           Em
I try to capture every minute
     G       D
The feeling in it
                     Asus4  A       D
Slipping through my fingers all the time
             G                D
Do I really see what's in her mind
            F#m                 Em
Each time I think I'm close to knowing
      G        D
She keeps on growing
                      Asus4  A      D
Slipping through my fingers all the time
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
G               Gm
Sleep in our eyes
        D       F#m
Her and me at the breakfast table
G       Gm
Barely awake
D                   F#m
I let precious time go by
G               Gm
Then when she's gone
              D        F#m
There's that odd melancholy feeling
G               A             D
And a sense of guilt I can't deny
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
 
        G             A/C#       D       F#
What happened to the wonderful adventures
        G        A                 D  D/F#
The places I had planned for us to go (slipping through my fingers all the time)
G                    A/C#
Well some of that we did
             D
But most we didn't
   Asus4             Dsus4   D
And why I just don't know
 
 
[Chorus]
 
                      G             D
Slipping through my fingers all the time
          F#m           Em
I try to capture every minute
     G       D
The feeling in it
                     Asus4  A       D
Slipping through my fingers all the time
             G                D
Do I really see what's in her mind
            F#m                 Em
Each time I think I'm close to knowing
      G        D
She keeps on growing
                      Asus4  A      D
Slipping through my fingers all the time
 
 
 
[Verse]
 
G                      A                  D       F#
Sometimes I wish that I could freeze the picture
G                     A               D
And save it from the funny tricks of time
  D/F#               G   A  D
Slipping through my fingers

Aaminin ko minsan ako'y manhid

Nais ko sana iparating na ikaw lamang

[Verse 1]
F                           Dm
 I wish I found some better sounds no one's ever heard 
Am
 I wish I had a better voice and sang some better words
F                           Dm
 I wish I found some chords in an order that is new
Am
 I wish I didn't have to rhyme every time I sang
F                      Dm
 I was told when I get older all my fears would shrink
    Am
But now I'm insecure, and I care what people think
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
          F               Dm              Am
My name's Blurryface, and I care what you think
          F               Dm              Am
My name's Blurryface, and I care what you think
 
 
[Chorus]
F               Em            Am      Em
  Wish we could turn back time to the good old days
Am         G           C                E N.C.
  When our mommas sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out
Am              G             C       E
  Wish we could turn back time to the good old days
Am         G           C                E  N.C.               F Dm
  When our mommas sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out
Am                F  Dm  Am  Am
  We're stressed out
 
 
[Verse 2]
F                                Dm
  Sometimes a certain smell will take me back to when I was young
Am
  How come I'm never able to identify where it's coming from
F                              Dm
  I'd make a candle out of it, if I ever found it
       Am
Try to sell it, never sell out of it, I'd probably only ever sell one
F                       Dm
  It'd be to my brother cause we have the same nose
     Am
Same clothes, home grown, the stones thrown from the creek we used to roam
F                             Dm
  But it would remind of when nothing really mattered
       Am
Out of student loans and tree house homes, we all would take the latter
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
          F               Dm              Am
My name's Blurryface, and I care what you think
          F               Dm              Am
My name's Blurryface, and I care what you think
 
 
[Chorus]
F               Em            Am      Em
  Wish we could turn back time to the good old days
Am         G           C                E N.C.
  When our mommas sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out
Am              G             C       E
  Wish we could turn back time to the good old days
Am         G           C                E N.C.
  When our mommas sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out
 
 
[Bridge]
   Am                              G
We used to play pretend, give each other different names
         C                                 E
We would build a rocket ship and then we'd fly it far away
        Am                                   G
Used to dream of outer space but now they're laughing at our face saying 
 C                        E
""Wake up you need to make money""
   Am                              G

  Wish we could turn back time to the good old days
Am         G           C                E N.C.
  When our mommas sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out

[Outro]
   F                             Dm
We used to play pretend, used to play pretend, bunny
   Am
We used to play pretend, wake up, you need the money
F                             Dm
Used to play pretend, used to play pretend, bunny
   Am
We used to play pretend, wake up, you need the money
F                               Dm
Used to play pretend, give each other different names
         Am
We would build a rocket ship and then we'd fly it far away
        F                                    Dm
Used to dream of outer space but now they're laughing at our face saying 
 Am
""Wake up you need to make money"", yeah

Darating din sa akin

Naubusan ng bakit

Bakit umalis ng walang sabi

Bakit, di sya lumaban kahit konti?
Cadd9        Am7
Bakit, di maitama ang tadhana?

Hey, I was doing just fine before I met you
            Cadd9                    D           Em7  D
I drank too much and that's an issue but I'm okay

What would you do if my heart was torn in two

More than words to show you feel

That your love for me is real 
                 D     Em     G      D    C
What would you say if I took those words away 
                              Am
Then you couldn't make things new 
         D               G
Just by saying I love you

And help me understand

I feel so unsure

As I take your hand and lead you to the dance floor

Calls to mind a silver screen

And all its sad goodbyes

I'm never gonna dance again

Guilty feet have got no rhythm
Bbmaj7
Though it's easy to pretend
  Am7
I know you're not a fool

Should've known better than to cheat a friend

[Verse 1]
C
Call you up in the middle of the night
Em/B
Like a firefly without a light
Am
You were there like a blowtorch burnin'
G
I was a key that could use a little turnin'
C
So tired that I couldn't even sleep
Em/B
So many secrets I couldn't keep
Am
Promised myself I wouldn't weep
G
One more promise I couldn't keep
 
[Pre-Chorus]
   F                G
It seems no one can help me now
    C                    Am
I'm in too deep, there's no way out
F                Em           G
This time I have really led myself astray
 
[Chorus]
C
Runaway train never going back
Em
Wrong way on a one-way track
Am
Seems like I should be getting somewhere
G
Somehow I'm neither here nor there
 
[Verse 2]
C
Can you help me remember how to smile
Em/B
Make it somehow all seem worthwhile
Am
How on earth did I get so jaded
G
Life's mysteries seem so faded
C
I can go where no one else can go
Em/B
I know what no one else knows
Am
Here I am just drowning in the rain
G
With a ticket for a runaway train
 
[Pre-Chorus]
    F                G
And everything seems cut and dry
C              Am
Day and night, earth and sky
F         Em           G
Somehow I just don't believe it
 
[Chorus]
C
Runaway train never going back
Em
Wrong way on a one-way track
Am
Seems like I should be getting somewhere
G
Somehow I'm neither here nor there

[Verse 3]
C
Bought a ticket for a runaway train
Em/B
Like a madman laughing at the rain
Am
Little out of touch, little insane
G
It's just easier than dealing with the pain
 
[Chorus]
C
Runaway train never going back
Em
Wrong way on a one-way track
Am
Seems like I should be getting somewhere
G
Somehow I'm neither here nor there
C
Runaway train never coming back
Em
Runaway train tearing up the track
Am
Runaway train burning in my veins
G
I'd runaway but it always seems the same

But I won't let them break me down to dust
                         A       D
I know that there's a place for us
              A
For we are glorious
 
[Chorus]
          D
When the sharpest words wanna cut me down
           Bm
I'm gonna send a flood, gonna drown them out
          G
I am brave, I am bruised
      A
I am who I'm meant to be, this is me
D
 Look out 'cause here I come
          Bm
And I'm marching on to the beat I drum
              G
I'm not scared to be seen

I make no apologies, this is me

[Verse 2]
 Bm              A                D
Another round of bullets hits my skin
           G             Bm           A
Well, fire away 'cause today, I won't let the shame sink in
      Bm                           A
We are bursting through the barricades
     D                            G    Bm
And reaching for the sun (we are warriors)
         A
Yeah, that's what we'll become
 
[Pre-Chorus]
G               A         Bm
 Won't let them break me down to dust

There's nothing I'm not worthy of

[Verse 1]
Am                            G
    Hello darkness, my old friend
G                                Am
    I've come to talk with you again
                      F      C
Because a vision softly creeping
                        F       C
Left its seeds while I was sleeping
         F                              C
And the vision that was planted in my brain
              Am
Still remains
            G        Am
Within the sound of silence
 
[Verse 2]
Am                               G
     In restless dreams I walked alone
G                             Am
     Narrow streets of cobblestone
                   F         C
'Neath the halo of a street lamp
                           F        C
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
         F                                        C
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
                      Am
That split the night
    C            G        Am
And touched the sound of silence
 
[Verse 3]
Am                              G
      And in the naked light I saw
G                                 Am
      Ten thousand people, maybe more
                   F        C
People talking without speaking
                   F         C
People hearing without listening
                F                        C
People writing songs that voices never share
                   Am
And no one dared
  C          G        Am
Disturb the sound of silence
 
[Verse 4]
Am                                  G
     ""Fools"", said I, ""You do not know
G                            Am
      Silence like a cancer grows
                      F           C
Hear my words that I might teach you
                      F           C
Take my arms that I might reach you""
        F                            C          Am
But my words, like silent raindrops fell
    C
And echoed
        G        Am
In the wells of silence
 
[Verse 5]
Am                               G
      And the people bowed and prayed
G                           Am
      To the neon god they made
                         F       C
And the sign flashed out its warning
                      F      C
In the words that it was forming
                         F                                              C
And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets are written on the subway walls
                        Am
And tenement halls""
      C               G         Am
And whispered in the sounds of silence

There I was again tonight forcing laughter, faking smiles

G                     Bm/F#
Walls of insincerity, shifting eyes and vacancy

Across the room your silhouette starts to make its way to me
    G                            Bm/F#
The playful conversation starts, counter all your quick remarks
    Csus2                   G
like passing notes in secrecy
        Csus2             Em7   D/F#

I wonder till I'm wide awake

All chords last for 1 bar except for the intro and the part of the chorus that
goes ""Oh I've..."" (Db Eb F C Dm F Bb C)
Two slash chords included. Of course you can leave out the note after the slash
and just use the regular chord shapes.
C/E  x-x-2-0-1-0
Dm/C x-3-x-2-3-1
 
Easier to play when transposed down 3 steps. To get back to the original key
put on a capo 3rd fret.
 
 
[Intro]
F C/E Dm Dm/C Bb Bb/C C F (Hold last F for a whole bar)

When are you going to land

It'll take you a couple of vodka and tonics

To set you on your feet again
Gm                   C

Searching for a sweet surrender
    F               C
But this is not the end
        Am
I can't work it out
  G
How?
                  C
Going through the motions
F               G
Going through us
 
[Pre-Hook]
    F                                C
And oh I've known it for the longest time
              G            F
And all of my hopes all my words
                            C
Are all over written on the signs
                 G               F
But you're on my road walking me home
Home, home
 
[Hook]
Am                         G
  See the flames inside my eyes
            F                        C        Am
It burns so bright I wanna feel your love, nooo
                      G
Easy baby maybe I'm a liar
          F                     C
But for tonight I wanna fall in love
             Dm          F
And put your faith in my-y stomach
 
[Verse 2]
         Am
I messed up this time
              G
Late last night
               C
Drinking to suppress devotion
    F             C
With fingers intertwined
        Am
I can't shake this feeling
   G
No-ow
                        C
We're going through the motions
F            G
Hopin' you'd stop
 
[Pre-Hook 2]
    F                                 C
And oh I've only caused you pain, you know
                G
But all of my words
              F
Will always below
                      C
of all the love we spoke
                  G               F
When you're on my road, walking me home
Home, home, home, home

It burns so bright I wanna feel your love, nooo

[Verse 1]
 
                   A               E
""Show me, show me, show me how you do that trick
    Bm                D
The one that makes me scream"" she said
     A                 E
""The one that makes me laugh"" she said
    Bm              D
And threw her arms around my neck
 A               E
""Show me how you do it
      Bm             D
And I promise you, I promise that
          A              E
I'll run away with you
          Bm             D
I'll run away with you""

A  E  Bm  D  x4
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
A                E
Spinning on that dizzy edge
  Bm                  D
I kissed her face and kissed her head
    A                  E
And dreamed of all the different ways
  Bm              D
I had to make her glow
 A              E               Bm
""Why are you so far away?"" she said
               D                     A            E
""Why won't you ever know that I'm in love with you
            Bm             D
That I'm in love with you""
 
 
[Chorus]
 
F#m
You
G
 Soft and only
F#m
You
G
 Lost and lonely
F#m
You
G
Strange as angels
D
Dancing in the deepest oceans
 
Twisting in the water
                   A      E
You're just like a dream
                   Bm     D
You're just like a dream

[Verse 3]
 
A                  E
Daylight licked me into shape
  Bm              D
I must have been asleep for days
    A              E
And moving lips to breathe her name
  Bm           D
I opened up my eyes
    A             E
And found myself alone, alone
 Bm           D
Alone above a raging sea
     A              E
That stole the only girl I loved
    Bm                 D
And drowned her deep inside of me
 
 
[Chorus]
 
F#m
You
G
Soft and only
F#m
You
G
Lost and lonely
F#m
You
G               D
Just like heaven

That we're making two reflections into one

The vacancy that sat in my heart
       A                  G
Is a space that now you hold

(oh oh) With anyone else beside of me
                             D
And now it's clear as this promise
           A            Em              Bm
That we're making two reflections into one
                           D
Cause it's like you're my mirror
    A                      G

Keep your eyes on me, baby, keep your eyes on me
 
 
[Chorus]
 
                             D

She'd take the world off my shoulders

If it was ever hard to move

She'd turn the rain to a rainbow

[Intro]
 
Bm F# A E G D Em F# 2x
 
[Verse 1]
 
Bm                        F#
On a dark desert highway, cool wind in my hair
A                      E
Warm smell of colitas, rising up through the air
G                           D
Up ahead in the distance, I saw a shimmering light
Em
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim,
F#
I had to stop for the night
 
Bm
There she stood in the doorway;
F#
I heard the mission bell
A
And I was thinking to myself,
              E
this could be heaven or this could be hell
G                                D
Then she lit up a candle and she showed me the way
Em
There were voices down the corridor,
F#
I thought I heard them say...
 
[Chorus]
 
G                        D
Welcome to the Hotel California;
       F#
such a lovely place,
       Bm
such a lovely face
G                               D
Plenty of room at the Hotel California,
    Em                    F#
any time of year, you can find it here
 
[Verse 2]
 
Bm                           F#
Her mind is Tiffany-twisted, she got the Mercedes bends
A                                          E
She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys, that she calls friends
G                                D
How they dance in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat.
Em                      F#
Some dance to remember, some dance to forget
 
Bm
So I called up the captain,
F#
please bring me my wine
            A                                  E
He said, we haven t had that spirit here since nineteen sixty nine
G                                       D
And still those voices are calling from far away
Em
Wake you up in the middle of the night,
F#
just to hear them say
 
[Chorus]
 
G                        D
Welcome to the Hotel California;
       F#
such a lovely place,
       Bm
such a lovely face
G                                     D
They're living it up at the Hotel California
       Em                        F#
What a nice surprise, bring your alibis
 
[Verse 3]
 
Bm
Mirrors on the ceiling,
F#
the pink champagne on ice
             A                               E
And she said we are all just prisoners here, of our own device
G
And in the master's chambers,
D
they gathered for the feast
Em
They stab it with their steely knives,
         F#
but they just can't kill the beast
 
Bm
Last thing I remember, I was
F#
running for the door
A
I had to find the passage back,
       E
to the place I was before
G
relax, said the night man,
       D
we are programmed to receive.
Em
You can check out any time you like,
F#
but you can never leave!

Dm                         Gm
Meet you downstairs in the bar and hurt
A7                             Dm
Your rolled up sleeves in your skull t-shirt
                               Gm
You say, “What did you do with him today?”
    A7                        Dm
And sniffed me out like I was Tanqueray
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
 
Gm
Cause you're my fella, my guy
E7
Hand me your stella and fly
F
By the time I'm out the door
    E7                 A7
You tear men down like Roger Moore

Dm             Am       E7     Am
I cheated myself like I knew I would

I told ya I was trouble, you know that I'm no good

Dm                   Gm
Upstairs in bed with my ex boy
A7                    Dm
He's in a place but I can't get joy
                       Gm
Thinking on you in the final throes
A7              Dm
This is when my buzzer goes
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
 
Gm
Run out to meet your chips and pitta
E7
You say, “When we're married,” cause you're not bitter
F
There'll be none of him no more
  E7                   A7
I cried for you on the kitchen floor
 
 
[Chorus]
 
Dm             Am       E7     Am
I cheated myself like I knew I would
  Dm            Am           E7               Am
I told ya I was trouble, you know that I'm no good
 
 
[Verse]
 
Dm               Gm
Sweet reunion, Jamaica and Spain
A7                Dm
We're like how we were again
                    Gm
I'm in the tub, you on the seat
A7                  Dm
Lick your lips as I soak my feet
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
 
Gm
Then you notice little carpet burn
E7
My stomach drops and my guts churn
F
You shrug and it's the worst
    E7              A7
Who truly stuck the knife in first

F
It's not simple to say
          C
That most days, I don't recognize me
           Dm
That these shoes and this apron
 
That place and its patrons
     Bb
Have taken more than I gave them
F
It's not easy to know
        C
I'm not anything that I used to be although
          Dm
It's true, I was never attention's sweet center
  Bb
I still remember that girl
 
[Chorus 1]
F
She's imperfect but she tries
       C
She is good but she lies
      Dm
She is hard on herself
      Bb
She is broken and won't ask for help
       F
She is messy but she's kind
       C
She is lonely most of the time
       Dm
She is all of this mixed up and
                     Bb
baked in a beautiful pie

And it's not what I asked for

Sometimes life just slips in through a backdoor
    Dm                                                Bb
and carves out a person and makes you believe it's all true
 
And now I've got you
F
And you're not what I asked for
       A7/C#
If I'm honest I know I would give it all back
      Dm
for a chance to start over
                     Bb
And rewrite an ending or two
 
for the girl that I knew
 
[Chorus 2]
         F
Who'd be reckless just enough
          C
Who'd get hurt but who learns how to toughen up
           Dm
When she's bruised and gets used
                   Bb
By a man who can't love
 
And then she'll get stuck
       F
And be scared of the life that's inside her
    A7/C#
Growing stronger each day
 
'Til it finally reminds her
   Dm
To fight just a little
                               Bb
To bring back the fire in her eyes
                                F     A7/C#
That's been gone but used to be mine
           Dm     Bb
Used to be mine
 
[Ending]
    F
She is messy but she's kind
       C
She is lonely most of the time
       Dm
She is all of this mixed up
               Dm/C      Bb
and baked in a beautiful pie
                               F
She is gone but she used to be mine

[Verse]
D               D/C#                    Bm                    A
There's no combination of words I could put on the back of a postcard
G           D/F#              Em            A*
No song that I could sing but I can try for your heart and
D    D/C#               Bm                 A
Our dreams and they are made out of real things like
G            D/F#             Em           A*
a shoebox of photographs and sepia-toned lovin'
D          D/C#                  Bm                       A
Love is the answer at least for most of the questions in my heart like
G              D/F#                Em                A*
why are we here and where do we go and how come it's so hard?
D               D/C#               Bm             A
It's not always easy and sometimes life can be deceiving
G            D/F#                    Em                 A*     Ab
I'll tell you one thing it's always better when we're together
 
[Chorus]
G*                 A*                        Ab G*
mmmmm it's always better when we're together
                       A*                        Ab G*
Yeah well look at them stars when we're together
                  A*                        Ab G*
Well it's always better when we're together
                  A*
Yeah it's always better when we're together.
 
[Verse]
                  D               D/C#          Bm                    A
and all of these moments just might find their way into my dreams tonight
G                          D/F#              Em             A*          D        D/C#
but I know that they'll be gone when the morning light sings or brings new things
        Bm                 A        G            D/F#             Em           A*
for tomorrow night you'll see that they'll be gone too too many things I have to do.
                D               D/C#          Bm                    A
but if all of these dreams might find their way into my day to day scene
        G            D/F#             Em          A*             D           D/C#
I'd be under the impression I was somewhere in between with only 2 just me and you
              Bm              A     G               D/F#             Em             A*
now so many things we got to do, or places we got to be we'll sit beneath the mango tree now
 
[Chorus]
G*                A*                        Ab G*
Yeah it's always better when we're together
                       A*                   Ab G*
 mmmmm we're somewhere in between together
                  A*                        Ab G*
Well it's always better when we're together
                  A*
Yeah it's always better when we're together.
 
[Interlude]
D      D/C#       Bm         A
Mmmm mmm mmmm
G      D/F#       Em         A
Mmmm mmm mmmm           
 
[Bridge]
Em                A*                  Em                  A*
   I believe in memories they look so, so pretty when I sleep, hey now and
Em             A*                 Em                      A*
   and when I wake up you look so pretty sleeping next to me but there is
G*           A*             G*                 A*
not enough time. there is no, no song I could sing and there is no
G*              A*                           G*                 A*
combination of words I could say but I will still tell you one thing we're better together

Hindi matigil ang gulo sa aking isip

Na hindi na para sa 'tin

 Asus2
Ipilit mang iba, ako'y maghihintay sa 'yo

Ikaw ang aking kapiling sa huling sandali

Kasalanan ba kung puso natin ang magwawagi?

Para sating dalawa ang maling pagkakataon
                  Asus2  Am
Na ika'y magiging akin

Get lucky
 
This is a simplified way to play ""Get Lucky""

Capo 2
Transpose +2 for original chords
The chords without the capo are Bm7, D, F#m7, E

which sounds better when playing an acoustic version! You can obviously
still use the correct chords with an acoustic guitar but the changes

as good!

[Verse]
 
G                Em      G
 I get up in the evening
                Em         G
and I ain't got nothing to say
                   Em
I come home in the morning
  G         Em               C
I go to bed feeling the same way
                    Am     C
I ain't nothing but tired
              Am                     G
Man, I'm just tired and bored with myself
          Em   G        Em                D
Hey there baby, I could use just a little help
 
[Chorus]
 
    D
You can't start a fire
                                 C
You can't start a fire without a spark
               Am   C
This gun's for hire
                   Am             G
Even if we're just dancing in the dark
 
[Verse]
 
G                     Em      G
Message keeps getting clearer
                   Em                G
Radio's on and I'm moving 'round the place
                       Em
I check my look in the mirror
  G               Em                   C
I wanna change my clothes, my hair, my face
                     Am      C
Man, I ain't getting nowhere
         Am                    G
I'm just living in a dump like this
                            Em        G
There's something happening somewhere
             Em              D
Baby, I just know that there is
 
[Chorus]
 
    D
You can't start a fire

Em                      G
 You sit around getting older
C                        D                 Em
 There's a joke here somewhere and it's on me
                             G
I'll shake this world off my shoulders
C                  D
 Come on baby, the laugh's on me
 
[Verse]
 
G                      Em       G
Stay on the streets of this town
               Em               G
and they'll be carving you up alright
                        Em     G
They say you gotta stay hungry
              Em                    C
Hey baby, I'm just about starving tonight
                   Am    C
I'm dying for some action
                           Am                        G
I'm sick of sitting 'round here trying to write this book
                Em     G
I need a love reaction
                  Em             D
Come on now baby, gimme just one look
 
[Chorus]
 
    D                                                      C
You can't start a fire sitting 'round crying over a broken heart
               Am   C
This gun's for hire
                   Am             D
Even if we're just dancing in the dark
    D                                                            C
You can't start a fire worrying about your little world falling apart
               Am   C
This gun's for hire
                   Am             G    C
Even if we're just dancing in the dark

G                   D
I'm good at wasting time
                        Em
I think lyrics need to rhyme
 
And you're not asking
        C
But I'm trying to grow a mustache
       G                        D
I eat cheese, but only on pizza, please
                   Em

Otherwise it smells like feet to me

I never trust a dog to watch my food

I see your face in my mind as I drive away
       G                         Dsus4       Cadd9
'Cause none of us thought it was gonna end that way

People are people and sometimes we change our minds

Music starts playin' like the end of a sad movie
G                              Dsus4         Cadd9
It's the kinda ending you don't really wanna see

Every little bump in the road I try to swerve
G                         Dsus4             Cadd9
People are people and sometimes it doesn't work out

Nothing we say is gonna save us from the fall out

[Verse]
 
C           G                  Am7     G
  I took my love and I took it down
C           G                       Am7     G
  Climbed a mountain then I turned around
      C        G               Am7          G
And I saw my reflection in the snow covered hills
         C         G          Am7    G
Well the landslide brought me down
 
   C             G            Am7    G
Oh mirror in the sky, what is love?
        C               G          Am7   G
Can the child within my heart rise above
      C                G        Am7   G
Can I sail through the changing ocean tides
      C          G       Am7   G
Can I handle the seasons of my life
 
 
   C     G     Am7    G
Uh ah................

Well I've been afraid of changin' cause I
C       G          Am7    D7/F#
Built my life around you

But time makes you bolder, children get older

Yeah and if you climb a mountain and you turn around
           C        G               Am7          G
And If you see my reflection in the snow covered hills

Well the landslide brought me down
 
       C        G               Am7          G
If you see my reflection in the snow covered hills

[Verse]
 
      Cadd9           G              D
Once upon a time, I believe it was a Tuesday
       Cadd9                      G             D
When I caught your eye, we caught onto something
         Cadd9             G                D
I hold onto the night, you looked me in the eye
            Cadd9     D
And told me you loved me, were you just kidding?
 
          Cadd9           G                 D
'Cause it seems to me this thing is breaking down
          Cadd9                     G          D
We almost never speak, I don't feel welcome anymore
          Cadd9
Baby what happened
                         G
Please tell me cause one second it was perfect
           D
Now you're halfway out the door
 
 
[Chorus]
 
            Cadd9                  G
And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
             D                         Em7
And then you feel so low you can't feel, nothing at all
        Cadd9             G                   D
And you flashback to when he said forever and always
 
           Cadd9                  G
Oh, and it rains in your bedroom, everything is wrong
   D                              Em7
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
       Cadd9            G                    D
'Cause I was there when you said forever and always
 
 
[Verse]
 
      Cadd9                  G                D
Was I out of line? Did I say something way to honest?
         Cadd9               G             D
Made you run and hide like a scared little boy
           Cadd9                   G              D
I looked into your eyes, thought I knew you for a minute
        Cadd9  D
Now I'm not so sure
 
             Cadd9     (G)            (D)
So here's to everything coming down to nothing
          Cadd9        G              D
Here's to silence that cuts me to the core
              Cadd9
Where is this going?
          G          D            Cadd9    D
Thought I knew for a minute but I don't anymore
 
 
[Chorus]
 
            Cadd9                  G
And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
             D                         Em7
And then you feel so low you can't feel, nothing at all
        Cadd9             G                   D
And you flashback to when he said forever and always
 
           Cadd9                  G
Oh, and it rains in your bedroom, everything is wrong
   D                              Em7
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
       Cadd9            G                    D
'Cause I was there when you said forever and always

                      Em D C
Did you mean it baby?
                 Em D C D
I don't think so
 
Cadd9 G D Em7 Cadd9 G D
 
   Em7            Cadd9
Oh back up, baby back up
           D
Did you forget everything?
Em7            Cadd9
Back up, baby back up
           D          Cadd9 D
Did you forget everything?
 
 
[Verse]
 
          Cadd9                  G
'Cause it rains in your bedroom, everything is wrong
   D                              Em7
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
       Cadd9            G                    D
'Cause I was there when you said forever and always
 
 
[Chorus]
 
           Cadd9                  G
Oh I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
             D                         Em7
And then you feel so low you can't feel, nothing at all

And you flashback to when we said forever and always

It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
       Cadd9            G                    D
'Cause I was there when you said forever and always
 
 
[Outro]
 
                        Em D C
You didn't mean it baby
                            Em D C
You said forever and always

C                 G            Am                   Em
Have you seen the old girl who walks the streets of London

Dirt in her hair and her clothes in rags?
C                 G            Am                  Em
She's no time for talking, she just keeps right on walking

In the all-night cafe at a quarter past eleven
F        C/G         Dm/F         G
Same old man sitting there on his own
C              G              Am         Em
Looking at the world over the rim of his tea-cup

Have you seen the old man outside the seaman's mission?

                          A7
My calling, I'm calling at night
   A7
I don't mean to be a bother,
     Cadd9~~                   G
But have you seen this girl?
 
                               Cadd9
She's been running through my dreams
                             A7
And it's driving me crazy, it seems
                            Cadd9
I'm going to ask her to marry me
 
 
[Bridge]
 
Em                           Cadd9
The neighbors said she moved away..
                         G
Funny how it rained all day
 
I didn't think much of it then
           D
But it's starting to all make sense
           Em7 (let ring)      Cadd9
Oh, I can see now that all of these clouds
       G
Are following me in my desperate endeavor
             D
To find my whoever, wherever she may be
 
 
[Juliet Simms]
 
     G                                       Cadd9
I'm not coming back, I've done something so terrible
                                                   A7
I'm terrified to speak, but you'd expect that from me
 
I'm mixed up, I'll be blunt; now the rain is
Cadd9                                     G
Washing you out of my hair and out of my mind
 
Keeping an eye on the world,
Cadd9
So many thousands of feet off the ground
    A7
I'm over you now I'm at home in the clouds
 Cadd9              A7
Towering over your head
 
 
[Alex Gaskarth]
 
  I guess I'll go home now..

[Verse]
D
He's got a smile that it seems to me
  Cadd9
Reminds me of childhood memories
      G                                         D
Where everything was as fresh as a bright blue sky
D
Now and then when I see his face
   Cadd9
He takes me away to that special place
    G                                                 D
And if I stared too long I'd probably break down and cry
 
[Chorus]
Am   Cadd9               D
Whoa oh, Sweet child of mine
Am            F        C/E      D
Whoa, oh, oh, oh Sweet love of mine

[Verse]
D
He's got eyes of the bluest skies
   Cadd9
As if they thought of rain
  G                                D
I hate to look into those eyes and see an ounce of pain
D
His hair reminds me of a warm safe place
       Cadd9
Where as a child I'd hide
    G
And pray for the thunder and the rain
   D
To quietly pass me by
 
[Chorus]
Am   Cadd9               D
Whoa oh, Sweet child of mine
Am            F        C/E      D
Whoa, oh, oh, oh Sweet love of mine

Artist: ABBA
 
Transcribed in friendly G, ABBA's recording is in F#, however.
To match the key of the recording:
- transpose this chord sheet -1 to F# or
- tune down the guitar on step to Eb-Ab-Db-G-Bb-Eb or
- transpose this chord sheet -2 to F and use a capo 1st fret
- transpose this chord sheet -5 to D and use a capo 4th fret (my preferred option)
 
Novice players may leave out the slash chords (see voicings below) and just
play the regular shapes (E7 instead of E7/G#, D instead of D/F#  etc.).

Building me a fence

Building me a home

Why should I complain?

But tell me does she kiss

Like I used to kiss you?

Does it feel the same

When she calls your name?
 
              G
Somewhere deep inside
                D/F#
You must know I miss you
               Am/E
But what can I say
               D
Rules must be obeyed
 
 
[Bridge 2]
           G
The judges will decide
    B7           Em
The likes of me abide
    E7/G#         Am
Spectators of the show
               D
Always staying low
 
 
[Bridge 3]
                G
The game is on again
  B7         Em
A lover or a friend
  E7/G#          Am
A big thing or a small
                    D
The winner takes it all
 
 
[Verse]
              G
I don't wanna talk
                D/F#
If it makes you feel sad
            Am/E
And I understand
                        D
You've come to shake my hand
 
       G
I apologize
                D/F#
If it makes you feel bad
             Am/E
Seeing me so tense
             D
No self-confidence, but you see …Z

Am            D
 And the loser has to fall
G           B7  Em       Em E/G#
 Throw a di-ice, cold as ice
Am             D
 Way down here, someone dear
G           B7  Em      Em  E/G#
 Takes it a-all, has to fall
Am                     D
 It seems plain to me ...

C       Am             F
Oceans apart day after day
        G       C
And I slowly go insane
C       Am             F
I hear your voice on the line
        G            Am
But it doesn't stop the pain
 
[Pre-Chorus]
Am             F

That I thought would last somehow
C        Am               F
I hear the laughter, I taste the tears

But now it's far too late, she's gone away
 
 
[Pre-chorus]
 
C
Every night you cry yourself to sleep
Am
Thinking why does this happen to me
D7/F#                                F
Why does every moment have to be so hard
G
Hard to believe it
 
 
[Chorus]
 
C
It's not over tonight
                      Dm
Just give me one more chance to make it right
                  F
I may not make it through the night
  G                 C
I won't go home without you
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
Am                                      Dm
The taste of her breath, I'll never get over
        G                             C     C/B
And the noises that she made kept me awake, oh
    Am                               Dm
The weight of things that remained unspoken
   F                 G                C
Built up so much it crushed us every day
 
 
[Pre-chorus]
 
C
Every night you cry yourself to sleep
Am
Thinking why does this happen to me

[Bridge]
 
Bb         F                  C            G
Of all the things I felt I've never really showed

Perhaps the worst is that I ever let you go, should not ever let you go oh oh oh
 
 
[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Em                        D
  I'm in the business of misery, let's take it from the top
Em                         C
  She's got a body like an hourglass that's ticking like a clock
Em                 D
  It's a matter of time before we all run out...
Em                      C
  When I thought he was mine, she caught him by the mouth
Em
  I waited eight long months
D
  She finally set him free
Em                         C
  I told him I couldn't lie, he was the only one for me
Em                     D
  Two weeks and we had caught on fire
             Em                         C
She's got it out for me, but I wear the biggest smile

[Verse 2]
Em                           D
  Second chances: they don't ever matter, people never change
Em                             C
  Once a whore, you're nothing more, I'm sorry that'll never change
Em                      D
  And about forgiveness, we're both supposed to have exchanged
Em                         C
  I'm sorry honey, but I'm passing up, now look this way
Em                             D
  Well there's a million other girls who do it just like you
Em                       C
  Looking as innocent as possible to get to who
Em                                   D
  They want and what they like, it's easy if you do it right

[Intro]
 
E7b9
 
 
[Verse 1]
 
   Am                        Dm
At first I was afraid, I was petrified,
              G                              Cmaj7
Kept thinking I could never live without you by my side.
           Fmaj7                          Bm7b5
But then I spent so many nights, thinking how you did me wrong,
           Esus4                 E
And I grew strong; and I learned how to get along.
 
              Am               Dm
And so you're back, from outer space,
              G                                  Cmaj7
I just walked in to find you here, with that sad look upon your face.
              Fmaj7
I should have changed that stupid lock,
              Bm7b5
I should have made you leave your key,
         Esus4                               E
If I had known for just one second, you'd be back to bother me.
 
 
[Chorus]
 
           Am               Dm
Go on now, go; walk out the door;
           G                          Cmaj7
Just turn around now, 'cos you're not welcome any more.
Fmaj7                               Bm7b5
   Weren't you the one who tried to hurt me with goodbye?
                  Esus4                      E
Did you think I'd crumble; did you think I'd lay down and die?
           Am           Dm
Oh no, not I; I will survive,
       G                             Cmaj7
Oh, as long as I know how to love, I know I'll stay alive.
         Fmaj7                         Bm7b5
I've got all my life to live, I've got all my love to give,
            Esus4           E           Am
And I'll survive, I will survive, hey hey

[Verse 2]
 
        Am                            Dm
It took all the strength I had not to fall apart.
            G                             Cmaj7
Kept trying hard to mend the pieces of my broken heart.
            Fmaj7                            Bm7b5
And I spent oh, so many nights, just feeling sorry for myself,
          Esus4          E7
I used to cry, but now I hold my head up high.
            Am           Dm
And you see me; somebody new,
             G                                  Cmaj7
I'm not that chained up little person, still in love with you.
           Fmaj7                            Bm7b5
And so you felt like dropping in and just expect me to be free,
        Esus4                         E
Now I'm saving all my loving, for someone who's loving me.

Go on now, go; walk out the door;

Bless The Broken Road

[Intro]
 
C G Am F G C (x2)
 
 
[Verse 1]
 
C              G      Am  F    G       C
I set out on a narrow way many years ago
C               G        Am     F        G       C
Hoping I would find true love along the broken road
    Am            G
But I got lost a time or two
    F                   C
Wiped my brow and kept pushing through
C                  G     Am   F       G            C
I couldn't see how every sign pointed straight to you
 
 
[Chorus]
 
       F         C                 G        C
Every long lost dream lead me to where you are
            F        Am                    F        G
Others who broke my heart they were like northern stars
             F      C             G     Am
Pointing me on my way into your loving arms
            F
This much I know is true..
      C                 G    Am        F        G         C
That God blessed the broken road that led me straight to you

[Verse 2]
 
  C                G       Am    F      G        C
I think about the years I spent just passing through
     C                G      Am   F           G       C
I'd like to have the time I lost and give it back to you
     Am                  G
But you just smile and take my hand
F                      C
You've been there you understand
C                   G        Am   F       G      C
It's all part of a grander plan that is coming true
 
 
[Chorus]
 
       F         C                 G        C

That's it...on the ""oooo""s at the end is where Gary does some of his finest beautiful
vocal improvisation. I've hit his notes a few times and if you can hit them (Guys mostly)
they are really tons of fun to sing.  Good luck with this and enjoy.
 
Rock On!

[Verse]
 
 Em                        Em
  Never feared for anything
                             Em
  Never shamed but never free
    G                     D
  A laugh that healed the broken heart
       Bm          C
  With all that it could
 
 Em                          Em
  Lived the life so endlessly
                            Em
  Saw beyond what others see
    G                  D
  I tried to heal your broken heart
       Bm         C
  With all that I could
 
  C
  Will you stay?
  D
  Will you stay away forever?
 
 
[Chorus]
 
  Em                        G
  How do i live without the ones i love?
  Am                                Em             D
  Time still turns the pages of the book it's burned
  Em                    G
  Place and time always on my mind
    Am                                C       D
  I have so much to say but you're so far away
 
 
[Verse]
 
 Em                               Em
  Plans of what our features hold
                              Em
  Foolish lies of growin' old
     G                  D           Bm          C
  It seems we're so invincible, the truth is so cold
 
 Em                            Em
  A final song, a last request
                                 Em
  A perfect chapter laid to rest
  G              D             Bm          C
  Now and then I try to find a place in my mind
 
        C
  Where you can stay
  D
  You can stay awake forever
 
 
[Chorus]
 
  Em                        G
  How do I live without the ones i love?
  Am                                Em             D
  Time still turns the pages of the book it's burned
  Em                    G
  Place and time always on my mind
    Am                                C       D
  I have so much to say but you're so far away
 
 
[Bridge]
 
  E                C
  Sleep tight, I'm not afraid
      Am                      Em
  The ones that we love are here with me
  E          C
  Lay away a place for me
            D                            C
  'Cause as soon as I'm done, I'll be on my way
     D
  To live eternally

[Solo lyrics]
 
I love you
You were ready
The pain is strong and urges rise
But I'll see you
When He lets me
Your pain is gone, your hands untied
 
So far away
And I need you to know
 
So far away
And I need you to, need you to know...

   Ha well, ain't that some shit (Ain't that some shit)

[Verse 1]
             A             G          A             Bm
I've been reading books of old, the legends and the myths
     A           G          A           Bm
Achilles and his gold, Hercules and his gifts
   A           G           A            Bm
Spiderman's control and Batman with his fists
A           G                  A         Bm
And clearly I don't see myself upon that list
 
 
[Pre-Chorus 1]
                    A           G            A         Bm
But she said, where'd you wanna go, how much you wanna risk?
           A            G                A        Bm
I'm not looking for somebody with some superhuman gifts
       A      G         A      Bm
Some superhero, some fairytale bliss
         A           G              A        Bm
Just something I can turn to, somebody I can kiss
 
 
[Chorus 1]
           A              G                   A           Bm

             A       G             A           Bm

              A              G                   A           Bm

[Verse 2]
             A             G          A             Bm
I've been reading books of old, the legends and the myths
       A            G              A        Bm
The testaments they told, the moon and its eclipse
      A        G             A         Bm
And Superman unrolls, a suit before he lifts
A         G                  A           Bm
  But I'm not the kind of person that it fits

Some superhero, some fairytale bliss
         A           G              A        Bm
Just something I can turn to, somebody I can miss
 
 
[Chorus 2]
           A              G     A  Bm   A  G  A  Bm
I want something just like this

[Verse 1]
D         A/D        D                       G
I've been cheated by you, since I don't know when
D    A/D        D                        G
So I made up my mind, it must come to an end
D               Daug
Look at me now, will I ever learn?
D              Daug              G
I don't know how, but I suddenly lose control
                   A
There's a fire within my soul

D       A/D           D                              G
I can't count all the times that I've told you we're through

And when you go, when you slam the door

Price you gotta pay when you break the panorama
Am         G                   Dm       Am
 She never knew that there was anything more than poor,
Am           G               Dm      Am
 What in the world does your company take me for?
 
[Verse 2]
Am             G
Black bandana, sweet Louisiana,
Dm                       Am
Robbin' on a bank in the state of Indiana,
Am               G
 She's a runner, rebel and a stunner,
Dm                        Am
On her merry way sayin', ""baby whatcha gonna""
Am                 G           Dm         Am
  Lookin' down the barrel of a hot metal .45,
Am             G          Dm
  Just another way to survive

Am              G
 She's a lover, baby and a fighter,
Dm                             Am
Shoulda seen it coming when it got a little brighter,
Am                 G
 With a name like ""Dani California"",
Dm                      Am
Day was gonna come when I was gonna mourn ya,
Am        G               Dm        Am
 A little loaded, she was stealing another breath
Am         G         Dm

 Who knew the other side of you?
Bm             G      D             F#
 Who knew what others died to prove?
Bm           G       D         F#
 Too true to say goodbye to you
Bm
 Too true to say, say, say
 
[Verse 4]
Am               G
 Push the fader, gifted animator,
Dm                   Am
One for the now and eleven for the later,
Am             G
 Never made it up to Minnesota,
Dm                     Am
North Dakota man was a gunnin' for the quota
Am           G                Dm         Am
 Down in the Badlands she was saving the best for last,
Am       G            | Dm       | E7
 It only hurts when I laugh;  gone too fast

[Verse]
 
  Em                     G              D                   C
I come from down in the valley   Where mister, when you're young
       Em             G  C               G
They bring you up to do like your daddy done
        C                                 G           D    Em
Me and Mary we met in high school  When she was just seventeen
      Am                                G                     C
We'd drive out of this valley down to where the fields were green
 
 
[Chorus]
 
         Em          C        D                    G
We'd go down to the river And into the river we'd dive
    Em          C          D  C
Oh down to the river we’d ride
 
 
[Verse]
 
    Em                G       D                      C
Then I got Mary pregnant  And man, that was all she wrote
    Em           G                      C                  G
And for my 19th birthday I got a union card and a wedding coat
    C                                    G           D       Em
We went down to the courthouse  And the judge put it all to rest
    Am
No wedding day smiles, no walk down the aisle
     G                   C
No flowers, no wedding dress
 
 
[Chorus]
 
                   Em          C
That night we went down to the river
    D                    G
And into the river we'd dive
    Em          C            D   C
Oh down to the river we did ride

[Verse]
 
  Em                     G               D               C
I got a job working construction for the Johnstown Company
     Em                      G              C                 G
But lately there ain't been much work on account of the economy
    C
Now all them things that seemed so important
              G                 D            Em
Well mister they vanished right into the air
           Am                               G                    C
Now I just act like I don't remember   Mary acts like she don't care
 
 
[Bridge]
 
         Em                      G                       D
But I remember us riding in my brother's car   Her body tan and wet down at
     C               Em                      G
the reservoir    At night on them banks I'd lie awake
               C                      G
And pull her close just to feel each breath she'd take
           C
Now those memories come back to haunt me
      G        D      Em
They haunt me like a curse
       Am                                    G                C
Is a dream a lie if it don't come true    Or is it something worse
 
 
[Chorus]
 
               Em          C                 D                G
That sends me down to the river   Though I know the river is dry
               Em          C       D   C
That sends me down to the river tonight
 Em          C        D       G
Down to the river my baby and I
    Em          C        D  C
Oh down to the river we ride     Ooh...
 
 
[Outro]
 
Em  C  D  G   Em  C  D  C
Em  C  D  G   Em  C  D  C

She'd trade Colorado if he'd take her with him

At a truck stop diner just outside of Lincoln,
    G                     A             D
The night as black as the coffee he was drinkin',

He thinks of Colorado

And the girl he left behind him

Well, it's a winding road

When you're in the lost and found
         G            D/F#
You're a lover, I'm a runner

It's a shame about the weather

F                  G
I wanna see, wanna see them dancin'
Am                        Em
Walking around on those - what do you call 'em?
F     G
Oh - feet!
C                             Em
Flippin' your fins, you don't get too far

Legs are required for jumping, dancing
Am                       Em
Strolling along down a - what's that word again?

Street

Up where they stay all day in the sun

Wanderin' free - wish I could be

             F              G               Em       C
What would I pay to spend a day warm on the sand?
          F              G
Betcha on land they understand
                Em    E           Am
That they don't reprimand their daughters
             D
Bright young women sick of swimmin'
         Bb    G
Ready to stand
 
[Pre-Chorus]
 C                         Em
I'm ready to know what the people know
F                        G
Ask 'em my questions and get some answers
Am                Em
What's a fire and why does it - what's the word?
F       G
Burn?

C
When's it my turn?

Wouldn't I love, love to explore that shore up above?

Out of the sea
Gsus4        G
Wish I could be

Part of that world

[Intro]
                                   Am7
Well, can't you see that it's just rainin'
                          G7
There ain't no need to go outside
 
[Verse 1]
    C7        G           D9
But baby, you hardly even notice
Am7           C7
When I try to show you
     G7               D9
This song is meant to keep you
     Am7                  C7
From doin' what you're supposed to
G             D9
Wakin' up too early
Am7            C7
Maybe we could sleep in
G               D9
Make you banana pancakes
   Am7                C7      Am7
Pretend like it's the weekend now
 
[Chorus]
                                G7
And we could pretend it all the time
                             Am7
Can't you see that it's just rainin'
                          G7
There ain't no need to go outside
 
[Verse 2]
         C7     G       D9
But just maybe, laka ukulele
Am7         C7
Mama made a baby
G                    D9
Really don't mind to practice
        Am7              C7
Because you're my little lady
G7         D7
Lady, lady love me
         Am7              C7
'Cause I love to lay here lazy
G                  D9
We could close the curtains
   Am7                  C7     Am7
Pretend like there's no world outside

                                G7

There ain't no need to go outside
                        Am7
Ain't no need, ain't no need
       G7
mmmm mmmm

Can't you see, can't you see
                         G
Rain all day and I don't mind
 
[Bridge]
        Am7
But the telephone's singing, ringing
                              D
It's too early, don't pick it up, we don't need to
       Am7
We got everything we need right here
                           D
And everything we need is enough, just so easy
         Bm
When the whole world fits inside of your arms
      Em             Em/D#         C
Do we really need to pay attention to the alarm
        G
Wake up slow
     D9
mmmm mmmm
        G
Wake up slow

Notes:
Use your ears! There's a lot going on that's hard to tab out, especially in the solo.
On the pre-chorus, you can probably get away with just strumming a D.
For the chorus bar chords sound nice on an acoustic, power chords sound
better on electrics.
For the vibrato on 10 in the solo, he releases to slightly above the 8th fret
(approximately a quarter tone above) 3 times if you want to be super specific about it.
The chord changes for the solo are as follows:
|D G | D/F# A |D G | D/F# A |D G |Bm A/C# |D Bm |Em A |G  | G D/F# G D|
(not entirely sure of the last G, possibly Em)
with |    | representing 1 measure. The A in the 4th bar is pushed an eighth note.
 
Additional Notes by Oliver K. Reichl:
There are at least five ""guitars"" in this tune.  The electric is
definitely some sort of Les Paul (of vintage stock with Scholzian
modifications, no doubt).
 
Guitar #1: 12-string acoustic
Guitar #2: 6-string electric (rhythm, power chords)
Guitar #3: 6-string electric (leads-melody)
Guitar #4: 6-string electric (leads-harmony)
Guitar #5: bass guitar

C
Give me a second I 
 
I need to get my story straight
     Am
My friends are in the bathroom
 
Getting higher than the empire state
     Dm
My lover she's waiting for me
 
Just across the bar
              F
My seats been taken by some sunglasses
G
Asking 'bout a scar
 
    C
And I know I gave it to you months ago
Am
 I know you're trying to forget
       Dm
But between the drinks and subtle things
 
The holes in my apologies
        F                          G
You know I'm trying hard to take it back
 
[Bridge]
              Dm      Em
So if by the time the bar closes
         Am        G       F
And you feel like falling down
       F       G
I'll carry you home
 
[Chorus]
  C
Tonight
       Am
We are young
                          F
So let's set the world on fire
 
We can burn brighter
         Gsus4  G
Than the sun
  C
Tonight
       Am
We are young
                          F
So let's set the world on fire
 
We can burn brighter

       C
Now I know that I'm not
 
All that you got
  Am
I guess that I
                                                      Dm
I just thought maybe we could find new ways to fall apart
 
But our friends are back
 
So let's raise a toast
F                         G
 Cause I found someone to carry me home

Carry me home tonight

So will someone come and carry me home tonight

The angels never arrived  but I can hear the choir

so will someone come and carry me home
