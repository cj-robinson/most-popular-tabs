A Em D Dsus4 D Dmaj9 Bm A (x2)
 
[Verse 1]
     Em                  D Dsus4 D Dmaj9
When routine bites hard
      Bm                 A
And ambitions are low
      Em                 Dsus4
And resentment rides high
     Bm                  A
But emotions won't grow
          Em                 Dsus4
And we're changing our ways
       Bm                A
Taking different roads
 
[Chorus]
     Em    D    Dsus4 D    Dmaj9 Bm    A
Then love, love will  tear us   apart again
Em    D    Dsus4 D    Dmaj9 Bm    A        Em D Dsus4 D Dmaj9 Bm A
Love, love will  tear us   apart again
 
[Verse 2]
           Em               Dsus4
Why is the bedroom so cold
        Bm          A
Turned away on your side
      Em                    Dsus4
Is my timing that flawed
       Bm          A
Our respect run so dry
            Em                Dsus4
Yet there's still this appeal
           Bm               A
That we've kept through our lives
 
[Chorus]
    Em    D    Dsus4 D    Dmaj9 Bm    A
And love, love will  tear us   apart again
Em    D    Dsus4 D    Dmaj9 Bm    A
Love, love will  tear us   apart again

A Em D Dsus4 D Dmaj9 Bm A (x2)
 
[Verse 3]
           Em                Dsus4
Do you cry out in your sleep
       Bm                 A
All my failings exposed
      Em                  Dsus4
Get a taste in my mouth
        Bm           A
As desperation takes hold
      Em                  Dsus4
Is it something so good
           Bm          A
Just can't function no more
 
[Outro]
Em    D    Dsus4 D    Dmaj9 Bm    A
When love, love will tear us apart again
D    Dsus4 D    Dmaj9 Bm    A
Love, love will tear us apart again
D    Dsus4 D    Dmaj9 Bm    A
Love, love will tear us apart again
D    Dsus4 D    Dmaj9 Bm    A
Love, love will tear us apart again

    C
And now we're not
  Am             E(E7)    F
I wish you would tell me why
                       C
Do you want to build a snowman?
                        F
It doesn't have to be a Snowman
 
Young Elsa: Go away, Anna
                     C
Toddler Anna: Okay, bye
 
 
 
                        C
Do you wanna build a snowman?
                              G
Or ride our bike around the halls
                          Am
I think some company is overdue
                F                             G
I've started talking to the pictures on the walls
(Hang in there, Joan)
                   Am
It gets a little lonely
                  C
All these empty rooms
         Am         E(E7)     F
Just watching the hours tick by
(Tic-Tock, Tic-Tock)
 
 
                           C
Please, I know you're in there
                               G
People are asking where you've been
                                      Am
They say have courage, and I'm trying to
                        F                G
I'm right out here for you, just let me in
              Am
We only have each other
           C
It's just you and me
Am            E(E7) F
What are we gonna do?
                        C
Do you wanna build a snowman?
 
 
Made some small changes in a chord I found. And here is the whole song. I just love this
one so much but its so sad :/

In the intro/verses: Em can also be played as Emadd9 (add the F# note) to sound more like the piano.
 
[Intro]

[Verse]
 
Em                  Gmaj7
  I've been here before
Em                    Gmaj7
  But always hit the floor
     Cmaj7
I've spent a lifetime running
      Bsus4
And I always get away
          Cmaj7
But with you I'm feeling something
     Bsus4              B
That makes me want to stay
 
Em                  Gmaj7
  I'm prepared for this
Em                  Gmaj7
  I never shoot to miss
      Cmaj7
But I feel like a storm is coming
       Bsus4
If I'm gonna make it through the day
             Cmaj7
Then there's no more use in running
        Bsus4              B
This is something I gotta face
 
 
[Chorus]
 
Em   D/F#  G      Cmaj7
  If  I   risk it all
Em      D/F# G        B
  Could you  break my fall?
          Em            D
How do I live? How do I breathe?
                 C               D
When you're not here I'm suffocating
               Em                   D
I want to feel love, run through my blood
            C                       Bm
Tell me is this where I give it all up?
    Am            Am7     Bm B
For you I have to risk it a-all
                             (Em)

[Interlude]

[Verse]
 
Em                     Gmaj7
  A million shards of glass
Em                       Gmaj7
  That haunt me from my past
       Cmaj7
As the stars begin to gather
        Bsus4
And the light begins to fade
         Cmaj7
When all hope begins to shatter
          Bsus4        B
Know that I won't be afraid
 
 
[Chorus]
 
Em   D/F# G       Cmaj7
  If I    risk it all
Em      D/F# G        B
  Could you  break my fall?
         Em             D
How do I live? How do I breathe?
                C                D
When you're not here I'm suffocating
               Em                   D
I want to feel love, run through my blood

Tell me is this where I give it all up?

For you I have to risk it a-all
                           Em   Gmaj7
Cause the writing's on the wa-aaall

The only problem was with you and not them

And every time you told my opinion was wrong

G         Bm               C             G
If you're travelin' in the north country fair,
G                   Bm           C     G
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline,
G        Bm    C             G
Remember me to one who lives there.
G        Bm    C            G
She once was a true love of mine.
 
G            Bm          C          G
Well, if you go when the snowflakes storm,
G               Bm         C      G
When the rivers freeze and summer ends,
G                 Bm    C       G
Please see if she has a coat so warm,
   G        Bm       C       G
To keep her from the howlin' winds.
 
G              Bm        C          G
Please see for me if her hair hangs long,
G               Bm        C        G
If it rolls and flows all down her breast.
G              Bm        C          G
Please see for me if her hair hangs long,
G          Bm      C          G
That's the way I remember her best.
 
G               Bm       C             G
I'm a-wonderin' if she remembers me at all.
G    Bm         C     G
Many times I've often prayed
G      Bm       C     G
In the darkness of my night,
G      Bm         C     G
In the brightness of my day.
 
G            Bm               C             G
So if you're travelin' in the north country fair,

Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline,

[Verse 1]
C   G                                     Am
    Clocks strikes upon the hour, and the sun begins to fade,
 G                                     Am
still enough time to figure out how to chase my blues away.
 F                G                      C                 F
I've done alright up 'til now, it's the light of day that shows me how,
     F        C    G/A               F     G

[Verse 2]
G                                     Am
I've been in love and lost my senses, spinning through the town,
G                                   Am
soon or later the fever ends, and I wind up feeling down.
F                   G
I need a man who'll take a chance,
     C                       F
on a love that burns hot enough to last.

somebody who , somebody who,   to hold me in his arms, oh!

I need a man who'll take a chance,

on a love that burns hot enough to last.

[Verse 1]
         G                      Am
From the day we arrive on the planet
      D                      G
And blinking, step into the sun
         Em                       Am
There's more to be seen than can ever be seen

But all are agreed as they join the stampede

You should never take more than you give
 
 
[Chorus]
                 G
In the circle of life
                   F
It's the wheel of fortune
                  C
It's the leap of faith
                 D
It's the band of hope
                 G/B        E7

[Verse 2]
  G                         Am
Some of us fall by the wayside
     D                       G
And some of us soar to the stars
     Em                           Am
And some of us sail through our troubles
      F                          D
And some have to live with the scars
         G                       Am
There's far too much to take in here
         D                      G
More to find than can ever be found
         Em                           Am
But the Sun rolling high through the sapphire sky
                  F                    D
Keeps great and small on the endless round

Na ako'y isang bituin
     Dm
Na walang sasambahin
A                   C#m

Try strumming the lower notes more predominantly to get the real bassy sound
Justin has. Might not be 100% correct so feel free to add corretions/suggestions.
The G might be a standard G but I never really play the higher strings when I play
it anyway. Cheers.

G
That secret that we know
        D/F#
That we don't know how to tell
       G
I'm in love with your honor
       D/F#
I'm in love with your cheeks
            Em
What's that noise up the stairs babe?
        C
Is that Christmas morning creaks?

And I said I know it well
I know it well ...

     G   Dm7add11        C             Cm
Desperado, why don't you come to your senses?
         G            Em7      A7        D7
You been out ridin' fences for so long now
             G       Gadd11        C                    Cm
Oh, you're a hard one, I know that you got your reasons,
      G           B7    Em7            A7       D7      G   D/F#
These things that are pleasin' you can hurt you somehow
 
[Chorus]
          Em                Bm
Don't you draw the queen of diamonds boy,
       C                    G
She'll beat you if she's able,
             Em7                C                G   D/G  D/F#
You know the queen of hearts is always your best bet
       Em               Bm                    C              G
Now it seems to me some fine things have been laid upon your table
        Em            A7             Am7
But you only want the ones you can't get
 
[Verse 2]
D    G   Dm7add11       C
Desperado, oh you ain't gettin' no younger,
     G              Em7            A7           D7
Your pain and your hunger, they're drivin' you home
    G      Dm7add11            C
And freedom, well, that's just some people talkin'
     G      B7  Em7                 A7        D7    G   D/F#
Your prison is walkin' through this world all alone
 
[Chorus]
           Em                   Bm
Don't your feet get cold in the winter time?
    C                      G
The sky won't snow and the sun won't shine
     Em7              C                   G   D/F#
It's hard to tell the night time from the day
       Em              Bm
You're losin' all your highs and lows
         C             G             Am7  Am7add11  D
Ain't it funny how the feelin' goes away
 
[Verse 3]
     G   Dm7add11        C              Cm
Desperado, why don't you come to your senses
     G         D/F#  Em   A7              D7
Come down from your fences, open the gate
          G      G7               C                 Cm
It may be rainin',  but there's a rainbow above you
           G       B7    Em       C       G/B   Am7
You better let somebody love you (let somebody love you)
           G       B7    Em        D             G
You better let somebody love you before it's too late

[Intro]
| Am | % |
 
[Verse 1]
    Am                          Am
She came to me one morning, one lonely Sunday morning
    G                        Am
Her long hair flowing in the midwinter wind
  Am                               Am
I know not how she found me for in darkness I was walking
       G                             Am
And destruction lay around me from a fight I could not win
 
[Chorus]
| Am             | G           Am |
  Ah...  ahah.. ahahah...  ahahah
| Am          G  |       Am |
  Ah...  ahahah...  ahahah
 
| Am | % | % |
 
[Verse 2]
    Am                           Am
She asked me name my foe then, I said the need within some men
   G                                     Am
To fight and kill their brothers without thought of love or God
      Am                           Am
And I begged her give me horses to trample down my enemies
   G                         Am
So eager was my passion to devour this waste of life
 
[Chorus]
| Am             | G           Am |
  Ah...  ahah.. ahahah...  ahahah
| Am          G  |       Am |
  Ah...  ahahah...  ahahah
 
[Verse 3]
        Am                               Am
But she would not think of battle that reduces men to animals
   G                       Am
So easy to begin and yet impossible to end
    Am                              Am
For she's the mother of our men who counselled me so wisely then
  G                                Am
I feared to walk alone again and asked if she would stay
 
[Chorus]
| Am             | G           Am |
  Ah...  ahah.. ahahah...  ahahah
| Am          G   |      Am |
  Ah...  ahahah...  ahahah
 
[Verse 4]
    Am                               Am
Oh, lady lend your hand outright and let me rest here at your side
     G                                     Am
Have faith and trust in peace she said and filled my heart with life
      Am                              Am
There is no strength in numbers, have no such misconception
    G                             Am
But when you need me be assured I won't be far away
 
[Chorus]
| Am             | G           Am |
  Ah...  ahah.. ahahah...  ahahah
| Am          G  |       Am |
  Ah...  ahahah...  ahahah
 
[Verse 5]
     Am                               Am
Thus having spoke she turned away and though I found no words to say
   G                                Am
I stood and watched until I saw her black coat disappear
   Am                      Am
My labour is no easier but now I know I'm not alone
  G                                 Am
I find new heart each time I think upon that windy day
    Am                                Am
And if one day she comes to you drink deeply from her words so wise
     G                                  Am
Take courage from her as your prize and say hello from me
 
[Chorus]
| Am             | G           Am |
  Ah...  ahah.. ahahah...  ahahah
| Am          G  |       Am |

[Verse]
           C
You cast a spell on me, spell on me
Em                      C
You hit me like the sky fell on me, fell on me
Em                     C
And I decided you look well on me, well on me
Em                           C                     Em
So let's go somewhere no-one else can see, you and me
 
                    C
Turn the lights out now
                         Em
Now I'll take you by the hand
                 C
Hand you another drink
                Em
Drink it if you can
                       C
Can you spend a little time,
                  Em                   C
Time is slipping away, away from us so stay,
                   Em
Stay with me I can make,
                  C
Make you glad you came
 
 
[Chorus]
 
             Em                   C
The sun goes down, the stars come out
             Em                  C
And all that counts, is here and now
      Em                      C
My universe will never be the same
             D
I'm glad you came
 
I'm glad you came
 
(The song repeats from the start of the verse with the same lyrics and same chord changes)
 
 
[Outro]
 
C             G                   Em
The sun goes down, the stars come out
             D                   C
And all that counts, is here and now
      G                       Em
My universe will never be the same
             D                 C
I'm glad you came, Im glad you came

A                                 Em                   Dmaj7
When i was younger i saw my daddy cry and curse at the wind.
  A                                                Em         Dmaj7
He broke his own heart and I watched as he tried to re-assemble it.
    A                                  Em        Dmaj7
And my mamma swore she would never let herself forget.
    A                                                 Em
And that was the day that i promised I'd never sing of love if it does not
Dmaj7
exist. But darling..

You are the only exception
Em           Dmaj7

[Verse 2]
 
  A                                Em                 Dmaj7
Maybe i know somewhere deep in my soul that love never lasts.
    A                                         Em                    Dmaj7
And we've got to find other ways to make it alone or keep a straight face.
    A                                      Em        Dmaj7
And i've always lived like this keeping a comfortable, distance.
  A                                        Em                   Dmaj7
And up until now I have swored to myself that I'm content with loneliness,
       A
Because none of it was ever worth the risk.

You are the only exception

let go of what's in front of me here.

I know you're leaving in the morning, when you wake up,

Our last summer, memories that remain
 
[Verse 1]
G                           Em
We made our way along the river

And we sat down in the grass by the Eiffel tower

Of the flower-power

But underneath

We had a fear of flying

Of growing old

A fear of slowly dying

Paris restaurants, our last summer

I still see it all
D                G     Bm               Em
Walks along the Seine, laughing in the rain
Bm          C       D           Gsus     G
Our last summer, memories that remain

[Verse 1]
D       A          G5            A           D    A G5 A
  It's amazing how you can speak right to my heart,
D         A        G5           A            D   A G5 A
  without saying a word you can light up the dark.
G5                   A
Try as I may I could never explain
D        A             G5          A    A    A    A
  what I hear when you don't say a thing.
 
[Chorus]
    D             A            G5            A
The smile on your face lets me know that you need me.
          D             A           G5           A
There's a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me.

D          A           G          A            D    A G5 A

Well I'd say 90-95% right. The only problem is that every tab on here has been
tabbed for 1 guitar, when in the real of it, there are 2 guitars. So here is the
proper tab with both guitars. Or you could just play 1 your choice! Sorry if it's
confusing, just e-mail me and ask about it! ( jm300club@msn.com )
 
Figure out the strum pattern on your own ! (sorry! to hard to tab that out, but
it's easy to figure out!)

I'd give you anythin'

[Verse 2] (gtr 1&2)
 
Em                          D
Don't you love the life you killed?
                     C
The priest is on the phone
                   G
Your father hit the wall
Your ma disowned you
Em                      D

Little pieces of the nothin that fall
    Em
Oh, May
               D
Put your arms around me
          C
What you feel is what you are
             G
And what you are is beautiful
   C
Oh, May
                 D
Do you wanna get married 
       C
Or run away?
 
 
Then continue the C and G then it goes back to the intr riff again to a fade. So
although it may seem confusing to some, others I am sure will get it. If you have
any questions at all pertaining to the song, e-mail me at jm300club@msn.com and
ill help ya out! Thanks!

I've seen other tab interpretations of this song and I'm a bit perturbed at what
seems to be some very tone deaf people out there. Not to say I am anywhere near
perfect in my interpretation but this seems to work just fine playing in a jam
session. (Note, Mr ""other people are tone deaf""'s tab has now been corrected.)

*   Alternate the B7(Open E) and the B7 in the verse.
**  When playing Em in the bridge, you can alternate the chord by holding B string
(3rd Fret) and high E string (3rd fret) back and forth.
*** I am well aware the last line of the bridge has a variance on the C to D. I
found this the easiest way to play it however.

**** Vocal Note: The chorus is actually two vocal tracks overlaid on the album.
 
For the purpose of clarity I will call them (a) & (b)
 
Chorus (b) continues while Chorus (a) and the Guitar Riff breaks in immediately
after singing 'fades' in  Chorus (b)
 
If sung solo, you must truncate (cut-off) the last part of Chorus (b)..(i.e. 'to grey')

on keyboards I keep a low ""D"" depressed throughout the song. (Actually I put a
roll of pennies on the key). I actually play the keyboard and guitar lines at
the same time using a volume pedal on my guitar.

I would not lend a hand

I've seen your face before, my friend

But I don't know if you know who I am

But I was there and I saw what you did
C
Saw it with my own two eyes

But I know the reason why you keep this silence up
 
No, you don't fool me

 A                    E
You walked into the room

And now my heart has been stolen
 A                   E                     Dadd9
You took me back in time to when I was unbroken

Now you're all I want

  F#m                        D
I’m tired of being what you want me to be
 A
Feeling so faithless
     E
Lost under the surface
  F#m                           D
I don’t know what you’re expecting of me
    A
Put under the pressure
   E                 D
of walking in your shoes
                              E
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
       F#m
Every step that I take is
  A                 D
another mistake to you
                              E
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)
 
 
[Chorus]
F#m             D
I’ve become so numb
                   A
I can’t feel you there
            E
Become so tired
              F#m
So much more aware
               D
I’m becoming this
               A
All I want to do
                 E
Is be more like me
                  F#m
And be less like you
 
 
[Verse 2]
                          D
Can’t you see that you’re smothering me
 A                     E                F#m
Holding too tightly afraid to lose control
                            D
Cause everything that you thought I would be
     A            E                 D
Has fallen apart right in front of you
                              E
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)
       F#m
Every step that I take is
  A                 D
another mistake to you
                              E
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)
           F#m                        A
And every second I waste is more than I can take
 
 
[Chorus]
F#m             D
I’ve become so numb
                   A
I can’t feel you there
            E
Become so tired
              F#m
So much more aware
               D
I’m becoming this
               A
All I want to do
                 E
Is be more like me
                  D
And be less like you
 
 
[Bridge]
        E        F#m  G#m  A  C#m   D
And I know I may end  up  failing, too
        E            C#m
But I know you were just like me with someone disappointed in you
 
 
[Chorus]
F#m             D
I’ve become so numb
                   A
I can’t feel you there
            E
Become so tired
              F#m
So much more aware
               D
I’m becoming this
               A
All I want to do
                 E
Is be more like me
                  F#m
And be less like you
 
                D
I've become so numb
                   A
I can't feel you there
                         E
(Tired of being what you want me to be)
 
F#m             D
I've become so numb
                  A
I can't feel you there
                         E

Em             Bm7              Asus2/C   Bsus4  B7
   And he may play the jack of diamonds,

   he may lay the queen of spades,

[Verse]
Cadd9       G               Em7       D               Cadd9
You were in college working part time waiting tables
        G          Em7          D
Left a small town, never looked back
Cadd9   G           Em7       D
I was a flight risk with the fear of fallin'
Cadd9             G           Em7
Wonderin' why we bother with love if it never lasts

I say can you believe it?
Em7     D                    Cadd9 G
As we're lying on a couch
  Em7            D
The moment I can see it
Cadd9  G Em7
Yes, yes I can see it now
 
 
[Chorus]

Do you remember we were sitting there by the water
Cadd9        G          Em7        D
You put your arm around me for the first time
Cadd9      G           Em7            D
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter

You are the best thing that's ever been mine

Flash forward and we're taking on the world together
Cadd9          G          Em7          D
And there is a drawer of my things and your place
Cadd9          G               Em7         D
You learned my secrets and you figured out why I'm guarded
Cadd9           G             Em7           D
You said we'll never make my parents' mistakes

You saw me start to believe for the first time

Braced myself for the goodbye

And every time I look at you it's like the first time

I fell in love with careless man's careful daughter

She is the best thing that's ever been mine

Frosty the Snow Man, was a jolly happy soul

        D                G
and two eyes made out of coal.

Frosty the Snow Man, is a fairy tale they say

just the same as you and me.
 
[Verse 4]
G                               C                G
Frosty the Snow Man,'  knew the sun was hot that day,
      C                           G
So he said, ""Let's run  and we'll have some fun

now before I melt away.""
 
[Verse 5]
G                           C                 G

Running here and there all around the square,
        C           D7  G
saying ""Catch me if you can.""
 
[Bridge 2]
   C                 Bm                    Am             G
He led them down the streets of town right to the traffic cop,
       D             Dbdim          Em                 D
And he only paused a moment when he heard him holler, ""Stop!""

Frosty the Snow Man had to hurry on his way,
       C                        G
But he waved good-bye, saying, ""Don't you cry;
        C     D7        G
I'll be back again some day.""

Song: Sunflower
Album: Into the Spiderverse Soundtrack
Key: D major
BPM: 90
 
Beautiful song. Simply a gem to listen to. Super easy to play as well if you're looking at
doing a cover of some kind.
 
 
[Intro]
               D
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy (Ooh)
               G
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ohh (Ooh)
     Em
Ayy, ayy
               G
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ohh
 
 
[Verse 1]
D
Needless to say, I keep it in check
 
She was all bad-bad, nevertheless (Yeah)
G
Callin' it quits now, baby, I'm a wreck (Wreck)
 
Crash at my place, baby, you're a wreck (Wreck)
Em
Needless to say, I'm keeping her in check
 
She was all bad-bad, nevertheless
G
Callin' it quits now, baby, I'm a wreck
 
Crash at my place, baby, you're a wreck
D
Thinkin' in a bad way, losin' your grip
 
Screamin' at my face, baby don't trip
G
Someone took a big L, don't know how that felt
 
Lookin' at you sideways, party on tilt
Em
Ooh-ooh, some things you just can't refuse
          G
She wanna ride me like a cruise and I'm not tryna lose
 
 
[Chorus]
D
 Then you're left in the dust unless I stuck by ya
G
 You're a sunflower, I think your love would be too much
Em
 Or you'll be left in the dust, unless I stuck by ya
G
 You're the sunflower, you're the sunflower
 
 
[Verse 2]
D
Every time I'm leavin' on ya (ooh), you don't make it easy, no, no
G                                                 Em
Wish I could be there for ya, give me a reason to go
 
Every time I'm walkin' out, I can hear you tellin' me to turn around
G
Fightin' for my trust and you won't back down
 
Even if we gotta risk it all right now, oh
D
I know you're scared of the unknown (-Known)
 
You don't wanna be alone (Alone)
G
I know I always come and go (And go)
                        D
But it's out of my control
 
 
[Chorus]
 
 And you'll be left in the dust, unless I stuck by ya
G
 You're the sunflower, I think your love would be too much
Em
 Or you'll be left in the dust, unless I stuck by ya
G
You're the sunflower, you're the sunflower, yeah

For simplicity, first, you hold the Em7 chord and pluck the D, D, e, B, D strings in the order twice,
then switch to D major chord and pluck the same strings in the same order.
 
Now for the intro strumming, follow the D-DU-UD-DU-UD-DU pattern
Switch between the Em & D major chords while playing the pattern on each chord twice.
Tip: If this pattern is too much for you right now,
then you can simply play the D--U-UD--U-UD--- pattern as well.

Follow the same pattern for the next verse.
 
Now, for the next part, you can play a single down strum for each line in a little
slower tempo, kind of like an arpeggio.
 
 
[Verse 3]
 
 Em
Kothe utte baihke
 Bm7
Aankhiyaan milaunde
 Am7        Bm7          Em
Na jaana humein tu kabhi chod
 Em
Tere utte marda
 Bm7
Pyaar tenu karda
 Am7    Bm7         Em
Milega tujhe na koi aur
 
 
[Interlude]
 
Play the intro tab here again for the following two lines
 
e|---0-------0--------------------------|
B|-----3-------3-----3---3------3----3--|
G|--0---0---0---0------0-----------0----|
D|2-------2---------4---4------4----4---|
A|----------------5----------5----------|
E|--------------------------------------|
 
Tu bhi aa…sabko chod ke
Tu bhi aa…sabko chod ke
 
 
[Outro]
 
 C                  D       Em  (Single down strum on each chord)
Meri aankhiyaan jo anju rul de
 Em                 D
Aankhiyaan jo anju rul de
 
 
The last verse follows the same pattern as rest of the song.

[Intro]
 
C                       F            C
Some nights I stay up cashing in my bad luck.
F             C         G
Some nights I call it a draw.
C                            F                 C
Some nights I wish that my lips could build a castle.
F              C                 G
Some nights I wish they'd just fall off
 
       F         C           F         C
But I still wake up, I still see your ghost.
               F         C          G
Oh Lord, I'm still not sure what I stand for, oh.
F          C          F        C
What do I stand for? What do I stand for?
Am                     G
Most nights, I don't know anymore
 
F  C  F  C  F  C  G x2
 
 
[Verse 1]
 
F                 C
This is it, boys. This is war.
F            C
What are we waiting for?
F             C                 G
Why don't we break the rules already?
       F            C
I was never one to believe the hype.
F                   C
Save that for the black and white.
       F                    C
I try twice as hard and I'm half as liked,
     G
But here they come again to jack my style
               F - C
And that's alright
            F           C
I found a martyr in my bed tonight.
    F                    C
She stops my bones from wondering
     G                         F - C
Just who I am, who I am, who I am.
         F - C      F - C     G
Yeah, oh who am I    mmmm   mmmmm
 
 
[Hook]
 
F             C               F         C
Some nights I wish that this all would end
        F               C               G
'Cause I could use some friends for a change.
     F           C                F         C
And some nights I'm scared you'll forget me again.
      F                C     G
Some nights, I always win (I always win)
       F     C              F          C
But I still wake up, I still see your ghost.
           F           C           G
Oh Lord, I still don't know what I stand for, oh.
      F    C               F    C
What do I stand for? What do I stand for?
Am                   G
Most nights, I don't know
 
 
[Bridge]
 
F               C
So this is it? I sold my soul for this?
G
Washed my hands of that for this?
I miss my mom and dad for this?
F                             C
No. When I see stars, when i see stars, that's all they are.
         G
When I hear songs, they sound like a swan.
         F           C            G
So come on. Oh, come on. Oh, come on. Oh, come on!
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
F                   C
That is it, guys, that is all.
F                   C
Five minutes in and I'm bored again.
F                              C           G
Ten years of this, and I'm not sure if anybody understands.
F                          C
This is not one for the folks back home.
F                          C
I'm sorry to leave, Mom, I had to go.
F                     C             G
Who the fuck wants to die alone all dried up in the desert sun?
 
 
[Verse 3]
 
             F
My heart is breaking for my sister
         C
And the con that she called love.
            G
But when I look into my nephew's eyes,
F
Man, you wouldn't believe
C                                      G
The most amazing things that can come from.
                 F
Some terrible nights.
 
C   F   C  F  C  G x4
 
 
[Outro]
 
F                    C                      F              C
The other night, you wouldn't believe the dream I just had about you and me
F              C           G
I called you up, but we'd both agree
F            C                F     C
It's for the best you didn't listen
F           C                 G
It's for the best we get our distance.

Bbm      Ab       Gb
I won't lie to you

On all on your wasted crying

When you should be with me instead

I'll stop time for you

The second you say you'd like me to
Bbm                         Ab
I just wanna give you the loving that you're missing
Gb
Baby, just to wake up with you

Give me a sign

Take my hand, we'll be fine

I don’t know my name

  Seen my share of     broken halos
    G             Cadd9   G
Folded wings that used to fly
                 Cadd9         G        Em7
They've all gone      wherever they go

Just to help us on our way
G                  Cadd9     G              Em7
  Come to teach us,     then they leave us

And they find some other soul to save

Don't go askin' Jesus why

  Oh no, I see
   F                  Am
A spider web and it’s me in the middle
G      Em        Bm
  So I twist and turn

But here am I in my little bubble

Ah I never meant to do you wrong
    A                             Em

G       D                  Em
 Sunday mornings were your favorite
          G                Bm         Em
I used to meet you down on Woodscreek road
G             D                     Em
 You did your hair up like you were famous
     Am               G                    D
Even though it's only church where we were going
   G       Bm               Em
Now Sunday mornings, I just sleep in
               G         Bm         Em
It's like I've buried my faith with you
    G              Bm           Em
I'm screaming at a God, I don't know if I believe in
       Am                G          D
'Cause I don't know what else I can do
 
 
[Chorus]
          C                               G
I'm still holding on to everything that's dead and gone
              D                                 Em
I don't wanna say goodbye 'cause this one means forever
           C                                 G
Now you're in the stars and six feet's never felt so far
           D                                Em
Here I am alone between the heavens and the embers
       C        G          D       B7        Em
Oh, it hurts so hard for a million different reasons
             C               Cm                  G
You took the best of my heart  and left the rest in pieces
 
 
[Verse 2]
G                     Bm           Em
 Digging through your old birthday letters
  G               Bm           Em
A crumpled twenty still in the box
G                  Bm           Em
I don't think that I could ever find a way to spend it
     Am               G                D
Even if it's the last twenty that I've got

Puno ng saya at ng kulay
G            A     E
Di mauulit muli
 
     A                     F#m
Ang oras kapag hinayaang lumipas

Ang dami-daming bagay na hindi naman kailangan
     F#m                 E               D
Kung pwede lang bawasan natin ang mga tampuhan
   F#m                 E              D
Hindi mo lang alam, hindi mo pa nararanasan
  F#m               E             D
Kahapon sana natin di mo na pinahirapan
          Bm
Patawad muli

Di na muli ('di na muli)

'di kukubli aking tinig

D                          A
  of all the girls tossing rocks at your window
Em                        G

so I've got some things to say to you
D                     A                           Em                       G
  I seen it all, so I thought, but I never seen nobody shine the way you do

  It's beautiful, wonderful, don't you ever change
D                      A
  Hey Stephen, why are people always leaving
        Em                            G
I think you and I should stay the same

Bm             A                       Em                  G

On my own, pretending he's beside me,
    Bm7      E7                 A        A/G#
All alone, I walk with him till morning,
   G           F#7            Bm7

In the rain, the pavement shines like silver,

All the lights are misty in the river,
   G                 F#7                Bm7
In the darkness, the trees are full of starlight,
    Em7                        Em/D        A
And all I see is him and me forever and forever.
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
 
      Bb         Ebm/Bb     Bb     Bb/A
And I know it's only in my mind,

That I'm talking to myself and not to him,

I love him, but when the night is over,
      Dm        G7              C        C/B
He is gone, the river's just a river,
  Bb            A7              Dm
Without him the world around me changes,
    Gm                                Gm7                 C
The trees are bare and everywhere the streets are full of strangers.
 
  F             Gm                 F       F/E
I love him, but every day I'm learning,
      Dm         G7             C        C/B
All my life I've only been pretending,
  Bb            A7              Dm
Without me his world will go on turning,
    Gm                                                    C
A world that's full of happiness that I have never known.
 
 
[Outro]
 
F           F7/Eb          Dm
I love him, I love him, I love him,
    Bbm/Db      F
But only on my own.

Tabbed By Ken Boldt with much help from other tab sites
 
This is just the chords for those of you who just want to strum along like I do and
don't care so much for picking out the individual notes
 
-----------
Chords:
G    320003
F    X33211
C    X32010
D    X00230 or X00232 (play with it for variety)
Em   022000
G/B  X20003
Am7  X02010
-----------
 
A couple of notes:
1) in order to be in the correct key, capo on the 2nd fret.
2) Use the first string (high E) seldomly.  Gordon plays this song entirely picking and
rarely picks the first string.

    C            G/B
And I will never be set free
   Am7           D                    G
As long as I'm a ghost that you can't see

[Verse 2]
 
G
   If I could read your mind love
F
   What a tale your thoughts could tell
G
   Just like a paperback novel
F
   The kind that drugstores sell
G                       G7             C
   When you reach the part where the heartaches come
    D             Em
The hero would be me
    C            G
But heroes often fail
    C                   G/B
And you won't read that book again
   Am7               D                G
Because the ending's just too hard to take
 
 
[Instrumental]
 
G F G F
 
 
[Verse 3]
 
G           G7         C
  I'd walk away like a movie star
         D                     Em
Who gets burned in a three way script
C            G
Enter number two
  C              G/B
A movie queen to play the scene
   Am7              D                  Em
Of bringing all the good things out in me
        C                  G
But for now love, let's be real
    C                     G/B
* I never thought I could act this way *
         Am7               D
And I've got to say that I just don't get it
C                     G/B
   I don't know where we went wrong
        Am7
But the feelin's gone
      D                 G
And I just can't get it back
 
 
[Instrumental]
 
G
 
 
[Verse 4]
 
G
   If you could read my mind love
F
   What a tale my thoughts could tell
G
   Just like an old time movie
F
   'bout a ghost from a wishin' well
G                 G7      C
    In a castle dark or a fortress strong
     D              Em
With chains upon my feet
    C              G
But stories always end
    C             G/B
And if you read between the lines
       Am7                D              Em
You'll know that I'm just tryin' to understand
    C                 G
The feelin's that you lack
  C                     G/B
I never thought I could feel this way
         Am7               D
And I've got to say that I just don't get it
C                     G/B
   I don't know where we went wrong
        Am7
But the feelin's gone
      D                 G
And I just can't get it back

Saturday morning jumped out of bed

I'm not a perfect person

When I got the news today,
                            D
I didn't know what to say,
                             Cadd9
So I just hung up the phone.
G
I took a walk to clear my head
Cadd9                                 D
And this is where the walking lead.
                                 Cadd9
Can't believe you're really gone
Cadd9
I don't feel like going home
 
[Chorus]
G
So I'm gonna sit right here,
D
On the edge of this pier
Em                  Cadd9      G
And watch the sunset disappear
D (single strum)      G
And drink a beer.
 
[Verse 2]
G
Funny how the good ones go,
Cadd9                                 D
Too soon but the good lord knows
                       Cadd9
The reasons why I guess.
G
Sometimes the greater plan
Cadd9
Is kinda hard to understand
D                            Cadd9
Right now it don't make sense.
 Cadd9
I can't make it all make sense.
 
[Chorus 2]
G
So I'm gonna sit right here,
D
On the edge of this pier
Em                   Cadd9        G
And watch the sunset disappear
D                             G
And drink a beer
 
[Bridge]
Cadd9          D        Em      D    Cadd9
So long my friend, until we meet again
           Cadd9     D
Well I'll remember you
 
             Em   D    Cadd9
And all the times that we used to
 
[Chorus 3]
G
Sit right here,
D
On the edge of this pier
Em                   Cadd9          G
And watch the sunset disappear
D                           G
And drink a beer

[Verse 1]
 
          Am
In their eyes is the place that you finally discovered
          F
That you love it here, you've got to stay
        Dm
On the bottom of the rock, an island
                       Am
On which you find you love it when you twitch
                            F
You feel that itch in you pettycoat
               Dm

           Am
Then you smiled, he got wild
                                     F
You didn't understand that there's money to be made

Beauty is a card that must get played

So be yourself don't get out of place

Love your man and love him twice
                       Am
Go to Hollywood and pay the price
                            F
Oh go to Hollywood
 
          Am
And don't be a star, it's such a drag
     F
Take care of yourself, don't begin to lag

It's a hard life to live, so live it well

Capo on 4th fret
 
 
A lot of people were having trouble understanding my capo directions so I changed it.
Just play these as shown (absolute fret positions) with the capo still on the fourth fret.

Note: He doesn't play a normal F, he plays a modified one that looks like this
e|----|
B|-1--|
G|-2--|
D|-3--|
A|-3--|
E|----|
I feel it's easier to play a normal F but you can play it however you want.

[Verse 1]
 
C      Am             Em*       Cmaj7*
Lady, where has your love gone?
      F                 Dm*         Cmaj7*  C7*
I was looking but can't find it anywhere
F           Dm*                 Em*               A*
They always offer when there's loads of love around
                 Dm*                  G*    G6    C
But, when you're short of some it's nowhere to be found
 
 
C        Am        Em*      Cmaj7*
Well, I know your game, you told him yesterday
F           Dm*                 Cmaj7*   C7*
No chance, you'll get nothin' from me
         F            Dm*          Em*          A*
But now she's there, you're there, everybody's there
        Dm*          G*     G6     C
He's in turmoil, as puzzled as can be
 
 
[Chorus]
 
        C7
Just like me
        F                E
Lets go down, down, low down
          Am               Dm
Where I know I should not go
       F                     E
Oh and she thinks she's the one
               Am      Dm
But she's just one in 24
               F    F     F
And just cause everybody's doin' it
           E        E  E
Does that mean that I can, too?
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
C      Am             Em*     Cmaj7*
Lady, where has your love gone?
    F            Dm*          Cmaj7*   C7*
He was the antiseptic to the sore
F                   Dm*          Em*          A*
To hold you by the hand must be first be in demand
        Dm*              G*      G6     C
How he longs for you to long for him once more
 
 
[Chorus]
 
           C7
Just once more
        F                E
Lets go down, down, low down
          Am               Dm
Where I know I should not go
       F                     E
Oh and she thinks she's the one
               Am      Dm
But she's just one in 24
               F    F      F
And just cause everybody's doin' it
           E        E  E
Does that mean that I can, too?
 
 
[Bridge]
 
Am                Em   Em* D#m Dm*
Her eyes went down and cut you up
              G*
And there's nothing like a dirty look from
Am          Em           Em* D#m    Dm*     G*
The one you want, or the one you've lost
 
 
[Outro]
 
C       Am      Em*                 F
An ache in your soul is everybody's goal
   Dm*            Cmaj7*         C7*
To get what they can't have
            F         Dm*                E7*
That's why your after her and that's why she's after him
    A7*                    Dm*       G*  G6       C
But saying it won't change a thing
 
C             Dm*        G*       G6       C        A7
And they'll realize that it won't change a thing
Dm*        G*      G6       C
Realizing it won't change a thing.

You know I want you
It's not a secret I try to hide

So don't keep saying our hands are tied

But you're here in my heart

So who can stop me if I decide
That you're my destiny?
 
[Chorus: Zac Efron]
            Gm           Eb
What if we rewrite the stars?

Say you were made to be mine

Because we're able to be

How can we rewrite the stars?

Realise how much I need you
 
 
[Chorus]
 
  F#m
I hate you I love you
   E
I hate that I love you
      C#m
Don't want to, but I can't put
D
Nobody else above you
  F#m
I hate you I love you
   E
I hate that I want you
    C#m
You want her, you need her
     D
And I'll never be her
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
F#m
I miss you when I can't sleep
    E
Or right after coffee
Or right when I can't eat
  C#m
I miss you in my front seat
           D
Still got sand in my sweaters
From nights we don't remember
F#m
Do you miss me like I miss you?
E
Fucked around and got attached to you
C#m
Friends can break your heart too, and
     D
I'm always tired but never of you
F#m
If I pulled a you on you, you wouldn't like that shit
E
I put this reel out, but you wouldn't bite that shit
C#m
I type a text but then I never mind that shit
D
I got these feelings but you never mind that shit
F#m
Oh oh, keep it on the low
E
You're still in love with me but your friends don't know
C#m
If you wanted me you would just say so
D
And if I were you, I would never let me go
 
[Chorus]
 
  F#m
I hate you I love you
   E
I hate that I love you
      C#m
Don't want to, but I can't put
D
Nobody else above you
  F#m
I hate you I love you
   E
I hate that I want you
    C#m
You want her, you need her
     D
And I'll never be her
 
[Verse 3]
 
F#m
I don't mean no harm
        E
I just miss you on my arms
        C#m
Wedding bells were just alarms
         D
Caution tape around my heart
F#m
You ever wonder what we coulda been?
E
You said you wouldn't and you fucking did
C#m
Lie to me, lie with me, get your fucking fix
D
Now all my drinks and all my feelings are all fucking mixed
F#m
Always missing people that I shouldn't be missing
          E
Sometimes you gotta burn some bridges just to create some distance
        C#m
I know that I control my thoughts and I should stop reminiscing
        D
But I learned from my dad that it's good to have feelings
F#m
When love and trust are gone
         E
I guess this is moving on
C#m
Everyone I do right does me wrong
    D
So every lonely night, I sing this song
 
 
[Chorus]
 
  F#m
I hate you I love you
   E
I hate that I love you
      C#m
Don't want to, but I can't put
D
Nobody else above you
  F#m
I hate you I love you
   E
I hate that I want you

You want her, you need her
     D
And I'll never be her
 
 
[Bridge]
 
F#m                         E
All alone I watch you watch her
                C#m                   D
Like she's the only girl you've ever seen
F#m                     E
You don't care u never did
    C#m                     D
You don't give a damn about me
     F#m                          E
Yeah all alone I watch you watch her
          C#m                    D
She's the only thing you've ever seen
F#m                   E
How is it you never notice
     C#m                    D
That you are slowly killing me
 
 
[Chorus]
 
  F#m
I hate you I love you
   E
I hate that I love you
      C#m
Don't want to, but I can't put

I hate you I love you

I hate that I want you

Having read the book....

Found my way downstairs and drank a cup

Found my coat and grabbed my hat, made the bus in seconds flat

Found my way upstairs and had a smoke

I heard the news today oh boy / Four thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire

Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall

[Verse 1]
 
A                G                           D
Wake up Maggie I think I've got something to say to you
     A                    G                D
It's late September and I really should be back at school
  G                D           G              A
I know I keep you amused But I feel I'm being used
   Em                     F#m       Em     Dsus2/F#
Oh Maggie I couldn’t have tried any more
    Em               A            Em                   A
You led me away from home just to save you from being alone
    Em                  A                  D
You stole my heart, and that's what really hurts
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
    A                     G                   D
The morning sun when it's in your face really shows your age
    A                   G                       D
But that don't worry me none, in my eyes you're everything
  G                   D         G                       A
I laughed at all your jokes, my love you didn't need to coax
   Em                     F#m       Em   Dsus2/F#  DM9/F#  A7sus2/E
Oh Maggie I couldn’t have tried any more
        Em           A            Em                  A
You led me away from home just to save you from being alone
    Em                     A          G      D
You stole my soul that's a pain I can do without
 
 
[Verse 3]
 
A                  G                D
All I needed was a friend to lend a guiding hand
        A                       G                       D
But you turned into a lover and mother what a lover you wore me out
G                        D              G                      A
All you did was wreck my bed And in the morning kick me in the head
   Em                     F#m       Em   Dsus2/F#
Oh Maggie I couldn’t have tried any more
    Em               A               Em                 A
You led me away from home 'cause you didn't want to be alone
    Em                        A         G    D
You stole my heart I couldn't leave you if I tried

A                 G                           D
I suppose I could collect my books and get on back to school
   A                G                            D
Or steal my daddy's cue and make a living out of playing pool
   G                           D         G               A
Or find myself a rock and roll band that needs a helping hand
   Em                 F#m             Em   Dsus2/F#
Oh Maggie, I wish I'd never seen your face
           Em                      A              Em                  A
You made a first class fool out of me, but I'm as blind as a fool can be
    Em                   A        G  D
You stole my heart but I love you anyway

you mustn't underestimate that when you are in doubt

[Verse 1]
Em7                    D          Am7
  She calls out to the man on the street
Em7              D
   ""Sir, can you help me?
Em7                   D          Am7
   It's cold and I've nowhere to sleep,
Em7                           D
   Is there somewhere you can tell me?""
Em7             D            Am7
   He walks on, doesn't look back
Em7                     D
   He pretends he can't hear her
Em7                        D           Am7
   Starts to whistle as he crosses the street
Em7                      D
    Seems embarrassed to be there
 
 
[Chorus]
Em7       D/E                   C/E
Oh, think twice, 'cause it's an other day for
              D/E
You and me in paradise
Em7       D/E                   C/E
Oh, think twice, 'cause it's an other day for you,
D       Em    D  C

   She calls out to the man on the street

   He can see she's been crying
Em7                          D            Am7
   She's got blisters on the soles of her feet
Em7                          D
    She can't walk but she's trying

[Verse 3]
Em7                      D            Am7

   You can see that she's been there
Em7                         D     Am7

D                              A
Hey, don't write yourself off yet.
                            G                        D
It's only in your head you feel left out or looked down on.
               D                        A
Just try your best, try everything you can.
                               G                               D

        N.C.  D                                           A

                G                                         D

Hey, you know they're all the same.
                             G                         D
You know you're doing better on your own, so don't buy in.
            D                            A
Live right now.       Yeah, just be yourself.
                            G                        D
It doesn't matter if it's good enough       for someone else.
 
[Chorus]
        N.C.  D                                           A

I'm not a perfect person

Shorty get down, good Lord
Baby got 'em up open all over town
Strictly biz, she don't play around
Cover much ground, got game by the pound
Getting paid is a forte
Each and every day, true player way

I think about the girl all the time (well, well)

I'm spilling out

Upon this linoleum ground

I'm reeling in my brain again

[Verse 1]
 
           G                    D
Come, thou Fount of every blessing,
        C                 G
tune my heart to sing thy grace;
            G             D
streams of mercy, never ceasing,
           C                G
call for songs of loudest praise.
         G              Em
Teach me some melodious sonnet,
         C              G
sung by flaming tongues above.
          G                D
Praise the mount! I'm fixed upon it,
         C              G
mount of thy unchanging love.
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
   G                 D
Here I raise my Ebenezer;
        C               G
hither by thy help I'm come;
      G                   D
and I hope, by thy good pleasure,
       C               G
safely to arrive at home.
       G                 Em
Jesus sought me when a stranger,
          C                 G
wandering from the fold of God;
       G                D
he, to rescue me from danger,
     C                G
interposed his precious blood.

      G                 D
O to grace how great a debtor
      C                  G
daily I'm constrained to be!
        G                D
Let thy goodness, like a fetter,
        C                  G
bind my wandering heart to thee.
         G                    Em
Prone to wander, Lord, I feel it,
         C               G
prone to leave the God I love;
          G                 D
here's my heart, O take and seal it,
        C               G
seal it for thy courts above.

A hole inside my heart

[Verse 1]
Em               G
   Slow down you crazy child
       D                 F
You're so ambitious for a juvenile
            C                       G
But then if you're so smart tell me why
                   A    B9sus  B
are you still so afraid
 
Em                              G
   Where's the fire, what's the hurry about
          D                       F
You better cool it off before you burn it out
        C
You got so much to do and only
G                   F#m   B9sus  B
So many hours in a day
 
 
[Chorus 1]
C                            D
  But you know that when the truth is told
             G             D/F#
That you can get what you want
           Em        G/D
Or you can just get old
            C                    F#m      B7      Em7        A7
You're gonna kick off before you even get halfway through  Oooo
              Eb7
When will you realize
D                 G    B5/F#
 Vienna waits for you
 
 
[Verse 2]
Em                  G
   Slow down you're doing fine
             D
You can't be everything you wanna be
  F
Before your time
              C                 G              A        B9sus  B
Although it's so romantic on the borderline tonight, tonight
 
Em                      G
   Too bad but it's the life you lead
           D
You're so ahead of yourself
            F
That you forgot what you need
               C
Though you can see when you're wrong
             G                             F#m           B9sus  B
You know you can't always see when you're right, you're right
 
 
[Chorus 2]
C                           D
  You got your passion, you got your pride
    G                   D/F#       Em        G/D
But don't you know that only fools are satisfied
C                      F#m             B7   Em7        A7
  Dream on, but don't imagine they'll all come true  Oooo

D             G
 Vienna waits for you

[Chorus 3]
C                D
  Slow down you crazy child
         G             D/F#
Take the phone off the hook
         Em           G/D
And disappear for a while
C                         F#m            B7    Em7     A7
  It's alright, you can afford to lose a day or two  Oooo
              Eb7
When will you realize
D             G
 Vienna waits for you
 
 
[Chorus 4]
C                            D

Why don't you realize
D            G
 Vienna waits for you

   I've gotta take a little time, a little time to think things over.

[Verse]
 
G                                       Am Em
  Happiness hit her like a train on a track...
G                                              Am Em
  Coming towards her, stuck still, no turning back...
    G
She hid around corners and she hid under beds
    G                 Am       Em
She killed it with kisses and from it she fled
     G
With every bubble she sank with a drink
    G           Am          Em
And washed it away down the kitchen sink

And the shy tormented youth sit way over there

Each one better than before

So you’re heading down the road
 
In your taxi for four
           G
And you’re waiting outside Jimmy’s front door
    D                                 F#
But nobody’s in and nobody’s home ‘til four

So you’re sitting there with nothing to do

Talking about Robert Riger and his motley crew

Song: Mr Brightside
Tabber: James Simmons
Comments: Quite an old song now but i play this acoustically and it sounds
so good. I put a capo on fret 2 because it suits my voice but it can be played
without.
 
Chords:
              eadgbe
       Dsus2 (xx0230)
   Dmaj7sus2 (x40230)
         G/A (3x0230)
        Bm/A (x20230)
       Asus4 (x02230)
 
it doesnt take a genius to work out this song is based around the shape and sound
of Dsus2 as every chord is shaped around the (xx0230)
 
 
[Intro/Verse 1]
 
this is repeated throughout the intro as well as verse 1, the chords are tabbed
below for those that wish to strum

[Verse 1]
 
    Dsus2                    Dmaj7sus2
        I'm coming out of my cage
                                 G/A
        And I’ve been doing just fine
                       G/A
        Gotta gotta be down
 
        Because I want it all
    Dsus2                     Dmaj7sus2
        It started out with a kiss
                               G/A
        How did it end up like this
                          G/A
        It was only a kiss, it was only a kiss
     Dsus2                Dmaj7sus2
        Now I’m falling asleep
                            G/A
        And she’s calling a cab
                            G/A
        While he’s having a smoke
 
        And she’s taking a drag
     Dsus2                   Dmaj7sus2
        Now they’re going to bed
                         G/A
        And my stomach is sick
                           G/A
        And it’s all in my head
 
        But she’s touching his
 
 
[Bridge]

        chest
                              Asus4
        Now, he takes off her dress

        Now, let me go
       Bm/A                       Asus4
        And I just can’t look its killing me
            G/A
        And taking control
 
 
[Chorus 1]
 
        Dsus2     G/A              Bm/A
        Jealousy, turning saints into the sea
        Asus4                 Dsus2
        Swimming through sick lullabies
        G/A             Bm/A
        Choking on your alibis
        Asus4             Dsus2
        But it’s just the price I pay
        G/A        Bm/A
        Destiny is calling me
        Asus4      Dsus2    G/A
        Open up my eager eyes

Don't you dare look at me that way

Oh, the burning pain
Dbmaj7                              Ebm7    Ab7

That when I talk to you

Oh, Cupid walks right through

         Gbmaj7  Ab7
What's a girl to do
 Dbmaj7                    Ebm7    Ab7
Lying on my bed, staring into the bluе?
  Dbmaj7
Unrequited, terrifying
Ebm7       Ab        Fm7   Bb7
Lovе is driving me a bit insane
     Ebm7                           Ab
Have to get this off my chest, I'm telling you today
 
[Chorus]

And shoots an arrow through my heart

But don't you feel it too?

Always looking down at all I see
         C               C/E           F

        C                  C/E         F
Waging wars to shape the poet and the beat

I hope it's gonna make you notice
F                  Am           C

This is a great version of this song that I found . . . somewhere.
I can't remember where I got this, but it's rather accurate.
I usually hybrid pick this song due to the kinds of chords used.

        D        Bm    G     D
 Baby, last night was hands down
              D        Bm
 One of the best nights
           G      D
 That I've had no doubt

 Between the bottle of wine

 And the look in your eyes and the Marvin Gaye
         D                          Bm                    G       D

 If I never get to see the Northern lights

 Or if I never get to see the Eiffel Tower at night

 Baby, and that red dress brings me to my knees

Called her for the first time yesterday
B                 A               E
Finally found the missing part of me
  B                 A             E
I felt so close but you were far away
B               A           E

D           A                      D
In constant sorrow all through his days

D                      G
I Am A Man Of Constant Sorrow 
          A              D *
I've seen trouble all my day. 
                         G
I bid farewell to old Kentucky 
                A              D
The place where I was born and raised. 
                A               D

[Verse 2]
 
D                               G
For six long years I've been in trouble 
             A               D
No pleasures here on earth I found 
                               G
For in this world I'm bound to ramble 
          A                  D
I have no friends to help me now. 
          A                   D

It's fare thee well my old lover

I never expect to see you again 
                                    G
For I'm bound to ride that northern railroad 
             A             D
Perhaps I'll die upon this train. 
              A             D
Perhaps he'll die upon this train. 
 
[Verse 4]
 
D                            G
You can bury me in some deep valley 
         A                 D
For many years where I may lay 
                            G
Then you may learn to love another 
           A              D
While I am sleeping in my grave. 
            A               D
While he is sleeping in his grave. 
 
[Verse 5]
 
D                                   G
Maybe your friends think I'm just a stranger 
               A            D
My face you'll never see no more. 
                                 G
But there is one promise that is given 
              A               D
I'll meet you on God's golden shore. 
               A               D
He'll meet you on God's golden shore..

         D              G         D
They say time takes its toll on a body
          G                            D
Makes the young girl's brown hair turn grey

But honey, I don't care, I ain't in love with your hair

And if it all fell out well, I'd love you anyway

They say time can play tricks on a memory

Make people forget things they knew

Well, it's easy to see it's happening to me

I've already forgotten every woman but you, oh darlin'

You made me insecure
Told me I wasn't good enough

And if there is someone who thinks: ""Hey that is wrong!""
Maybe you have heard version of Guns n' Roses. Because Dylan's and their version is different.
 
To match Dylan's recording from the album ...
- either put on a capo 5th fret or
- transpose this tab up 5 steps to G
 
The tempo is 74 a note.
The Em chords might be played as Em7

[Verse 1]
Em
There was a time
     G
when I was alone
C
Nowhere to go
       G
and no place to call home
Em                     G
My only friend was the man in the moon
    C                        G
and even sometimes he would go away too
Em                 G
Then one night as I close my eyes
C               G
I saw a shadow flying high
Em
he came to me
         G
with the sweetest smile
C                     G
told me he wanted to talk for awhile
       Em         G
He said Peter Pan that's what they call me.
C                       G
  I promise that you'll never be lonely.
    Am              D
And ever since that day
 
 
[Chorus]
Em               G
  I am a lost boy from Neverland
C                       G
Usually hanging out with Peter Pan
Em                        G
  And when we're bored we play in the woods
C                     G
Always on the run from Captain Hook
Em        G       C            G
Run, run, lost boy they say to me
 Em       G     C     G
Away from all of reality
Em                   G
Neverland is home to lost boys like me

[Verse 2]
   Em                             G
He sprinkled me in pixie dust and told me to believe
  C                   G
Believe in him, and believe in me
  Em                      G
Together we will fly away in a cloud of green
C                 G
To your beautiful destiny
      Em                         G
As we soared above the town that never loved me
  C                        G
I realized I finally had a family
Em                     G
Soon enough we reached Neverland
C                  G
Peacefully my feet hit the sand
    Am               D
And ever since that day

Forever a lost boy at last

And for always I will say

[Verse 1] (Willie Nelson)
 
Bm         A                     G                 Bm
   I was a highwayman, along the coach roads I did ride
A                G      D     A
  With sword and pistol by my side
Em              Bm            A             G
   Many a young maid lost her baubles to my trade
Em        Bm                A              G
   Many a soldier shed his lifeblood on my blade
Bm              A              G         A      D
   The bastards hung me in the spring of twenty five
    G           A       A
But I am still alive
 
 
[Verse 2] (Kris Kristofferson)
 
Bm         A             G             Bm
   I was a sailor, I was born upon the tide
A          G      D    A
  With the sea, I did abide
Em            Bm                 A           G
   I sailed a schooner round the horn to Mexico
Em         Bm                  A             G
   I went aloft and furled the mainsail in a blow
Bm              A                     G         A     D
   And when the yards broke off, they said that I got killed
    G           A        A
But I am living still
 
 
[Verse 3] (Waylon Jennings)
 
Bm           A                   G              Bm
   I was a dam builder, across a river deep and wide
A                 G     D      A
  Where steel and water did collide
Em                Bm             A        G
   A place called Boulder on the wild Colorado
Em               Bm             A               G
   I slipped and fell into the wet concrete below
Bm             A               G         A       D
   They buried me in that gray tomb that knows no sound
    G           A
But I am still around
 
 
[Bridge] (All)
 
                D           A/C#        Bm          A
I'll always be around, and around, and around, and around,
     G           D/F#     Em           G A D
and around, and around ...
 
 
[Verse 4] (Johnny Cash)
 
Bm            A                   G          Bm
   I'll fly a starship 'cross the universe divide
A            G         D     A
  And when I reach the other side
Em             Bm               A           G
   I'll find a place to rest my spirit if I can
Em           Bm               A       G
   Perhaps I may become a highwayman again
Bm          A           G      A       D
   Or I may simply be a single drop of rain
G            A
But I will remain
 
 
[Outro] (All)
 
                  D          A/C#       Bm         A
And I'll be back again, and again, and again, and again,
     G          D/F#     Em           G A D
and again, and again ...

[Verse 1]
C#m
    Counting days, counting days
                         A       E
Since my love up and got lost on me

C#m
  'Cause every word that I've heard spoken
          B                  A      E
Since you left feels like a hollow street

  I've been told, I've been told to get you off my mind
C#m                            B                            A

Oh my lord, oh my lord, I need you by my side

  Maybe I, maybe I'm just being blinded

By the brighter side
C#m
  Of what we had because it's over

[Intro]
 
G6                      A7       G6   A7
 Is this the real life?  Is this just fantasy?
D7           Am7  D7           G            Am7 G
 Caught in a land-slide; no es-cape from re-ali-ty.
 
Em7                   G7                  C   C/B
 Open your eyes, look up to the skies and see.
Am7                  D7
 I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy, because I'm;
 
G#    G     F#   G   G#     G     F#     G

 Mama, just killed a man,
      Am9                             Am7               D7
Put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger, now he's dead.

 Mama, life had just begun,

Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
        D                G               A         Asus4 A
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to.

Though I know that evenin's empire has returned into sand,

Vanished from my hand,

Left me blindly here to stand but still not sleeping.

My senses have been stripped, my hands can't feel to grip,

My toes too numb to step, wait only for my boot heels

Though you might hear laughin', spinnin', swingin' madly across the sun,
         D           G                D             G
It's not aimed at anyone, it's just escapin' on the run
                D         G             A
And but for the sky there are no fences facin'.
    G                 A         D                 G
And if you hear vague traces of skippin' reels of rhyme
   D                G            D                   G
To your tambourine in time, it's just a ragged clown behind,
   D                G            D                   G
I wouldn't pay it any mind, it's just a shadow you're seein'
          A
That he's chasing.

Down the foggy ruins of time, far past the frozen leaves,

The haunted, frightened trees, out to the windy beach,

Far from the twisted reach of crazy sorrow.
        G                 A                D               G

Silhouetted by the sea, circled by the circus sands,

With all memory and fate driven deep beneath the waves,

Let me forget about today until tomorrow.

https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/eddie-vedder/tonight-you-belong-to-me-chords-1215653,beginner,E A D G B E,5th fret,[],"This is my first tab, so enjoy. I am using a Capo on the 5th fret,
and the chords that you see are referring to the chord shapes, rather
than the names (since the guitar has a capo on it). There are a couple of
nuances done with some of the chords, like the D, the A and the Gm but they
are relatively easy to figure out.
 
 
[Verse 1]

C    N.C.
  I'm the son of rage and love
Am       N.C.
   The Jesus of Suburbia
    F
The Bible of none of the above
     G
On a steady diet of
 
C   N.C.
  Soda pop and Ritalin
Am   N.C.
   No one ever died for my
F
Sins in hell, as far as I can tell

At least the ones that I've gotten away with

And there's nothing wrong with me

This is how I'm supposed to be

In a land of make-believe

That don't believe in me

[Verse 2]
 
C  N.C.
  Get my television fix
Am  N.C.
   Sitting on my crucifix
    F
The living room or my private womb
          G
While the moms and brads are away
 
C     N.C.
  To fall in love and fall in debt
Am      N.C.
   To alcohol and cigarettes
    F
And Mary Jane to keep me insane
      G
Doing someone else's cocaine

[II. City of the Damned]
 
 
[Verse 3]
 
       C
At the center of the earth
       C/B
In the parking lot
       Am         G
Of the 7-11 where I was taught
F                      G
  The motto was just a lie
 
         C
It says ""home is where your heart is""
    C/B
But what a shame
      Am                       G
Cause everyone's heart doesn't beat the same
F                     G
  It's beating out of time
 
 
[Chorus 2]
 
Am      G
   City of the dead
C                F
  At the end of another lost highway
Am          G            F
   Signs misleading to nowhere
 
Am      G
   City of the damned
C                    F
  Lost children with dirty faces today
Am        G               F
   No one really seems to care
 
 
[Verse 4]
 
  C
I read the graffiti
       C/B
In the bathroom stall
         Am                   G
Like the holy scriptures of a shopping mall
F                        G
  And so it seemed to confess
 
   C
It didn't say much
       C/B
But it only confirmed
         Am                         G
That the center of the earth is the end of the world
F                         G
  And I could really care less
 
 
[Chorus 2]
 
Am      G
   City of the dead
C                F
  At the end of another lost highway
Am          G            F
   Signs misleading to nowhere
 
Am      G
   City of the damned
C                    F
  Lost children with dirty faces today

  Everyone is so full of shit
C                        Ab   G
  Born and raised by hypocrites
C                           Ab   G

  From the cradle to the grave

  We are the kids of war and peace

Dearly beloved are you listening?
C                         G                D
  I can't remember a word that you were saying

  Are we demented or am I disturbed?
C                               G            D
  The space that's in between insane and insecure
 
G   Bm   C   G D
 
G                            Bm
  Oh therapy, can you please fill the void?

  Am I retarded or am I just overjoyed
G                        Bm
  Nobody's perfect and I stand accused
C                                G                D

To live and not to  breathe
F    C  G      F  C G   F
  Is to die in tragedy

When you've been victimized

!IMPORTANT NOTE!:
if you play this in standard tuning along to the song it will sound awful.
That's because the song is tuned about 50 cents down, so 1/4 note (1/2 half note!!)

Capo 4
 
[Intro]
E G D C#m C B
 
[Verse 1]
      E           G
In my eyes, indisposed,
       D             C#m
In disguises no one knows.
           C               B
Hides the face, lies the snake,
     E             F
The sun in my disgrace.
         E             G
Boiling heat, summer stench,
            D                  C#m
Neath the black the sky looks dead.
         C                 B
Call my name through the cream,
          E                F
And I'll hear you scream again.
 
[Chorus]
            C
Black hole sun,
           B
Won't you come,
     E     D       G
And wash away the rain.
            C
Black hole sun,
           B               A               B
Won't you come, won't you come, won't you come.
 
[Verse 2]
       E              G
Stuttering, cold and damp,
           D                C#m
Steal the warm wind tired friend.
           C               B
Times are gone for honest men,
               E                 F
And sometimes far too long for snakes.
        E                G
In my shoes, a walking sleep,
        D               C#m
And my youth I pray to keep.
        C          B
Heaven sent hell away,
        E                 F
No one sings like you anymore.
 
[Chorus]
            C
Black hole sun,
           B
Won't you come,
     E     D       G
And wash away the rain.

Won't you come, won't you come.
 
            C
Black hole sun,
           B
Won't you come,
     E     D       G
And wash away the rain.

Won't you come,

Won't you come (Black hole sun, Black hole sun).

Won't you come (Black hole sun, Black hole sun).

[Bridge]
         E              G
Hang my head, drown my fear,
         D              C#m
Till you all just disappear.
 
[Chorus]
            C
Black hole sun,
           B
Won't you come,

Won't you come, won't you come.

Won't you come,

Won't you come,

Won't you come (Black hole sun, Black hole sun).

Won't you come (Black hole sun, Black hole sun).

music was arranged for piano/vocal/ guitar, which means the fingerings for
the guitar chords are completely off.  Use your favorite chord dictionary
to find the right fingerings.
 
""|"" stands for the bar line between measures.  There are two chords to a
measure for most of this song.  For the intro, alternate between the chord
and the bass note C.

C G Em  F
 
 
[Verse 1]
 
            C         Em
Two old friends meet again
    F        G
Wearin' older faces
Em              Am           Dm     G
Talk about the places they've been
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
            C              Em
Two old sweethearts who fell apart
    F           G                   Em     Am
Somewhere long ago - how were they to know
   F            Em
someday they'd meet again
              F             G
and have a need for more than reminiscing...
 
 
[Chorus 1]
 
  F          G             Em            Am
Maybe this time it'll be loving they'll find -
 F                     G                C   C7
maybe now they can be more than just friends
 F                 G             Em        Am
She's back in his life and it feels so right
       F           G        C
maybe this time love won't end
 
 
[Verse 3]
 
                    C             Em
It's the same old feeling back again
    F                 G            Em
It's the one that they had back when
                   Am                       Dm  G
They were too young to know when love is real
 
 
[Verse 4]
 
            C            Em
But somehow some things never change
F                    G
And even time hasn't cooled the flame
Em                 Am              Dm         G
It's burning even brighter than it did before
        F                 G
It got another chance and if they take it
 
 
[Chorus 2]
 
  F          G             Em            Am
Maybe this time it'll be loving they'll find -
 F                               G            C  C7
maybe now they can be more than just friends
 F                 G             Em           Am
She's back in his life and it feels so right
       F          F   G      C
maybe this time love won't end
 
 
[Bridge]
 
      F                              G
She's smiling like she used to smile way back then
     Em                           Am
He's feelin' like he used to feel way back when they
  F                  Em         F
tried, but something kept them, waiting for this
G
magic moment
 
 
[Chorus 3] (Key change to D)
 
  D                A              F#m          Bm
Maybe this time it'll be loving they'll find -
 G                     A                      D   D7
maybe now they can be more than just friends
G                          A             F#m   Bm
She's back in his life and it feels so right
                 G
maybe this time
                 Bm
Maybe this time
                 Em
Maybe this time
  G        A     D
Love won't end…

[Verse 1]
 
G
Right from the start
           C                  Em
You were a thief you stole my heart
    C                  G
And I, your willing victim
G                                  C                     Em
I let you see the parts of me that weren't all that pretty
         C                      G
And with every touch you fixed them
    Em                  A         D    G
Now you've been talking in your sleep, oh oh
Em               A      D   G
Things you never say to me, oh oh
Em                  A    D
Tell me that you've had enough
G      C     Bm   Dsus4 D
Of our love, our love
 
 
[Chorus]
 
G                             D/F#
Just give me a reason, just a little bit's enough
       Em                              Bm
Just a second, we're not broken, just bent
           D
And we can learn to love again
G                            D/F#                        Em
It's in the stars, it's been written in the scars on our hearts
                        Bm
We're not broken, just bent
           D              G
And we can learn to love again
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
    G                              C              Em
I'm sorry I don't understand where all of this is coming from
  C                    G
I thought that we were fine
 
(Oh, we had everything)
     G                              C                  Em
Your head is running wild again, my dear, we still have everything
    C                G
And it's all in your mind
 
(Yeah, but this is happening)
Em                 A        D       G
You've been having real bad dreams, oh oh
    Em             A        D   G
You used to lie so close to me, oh oh
        Em                A     D
There's nothing more than empty sheets
  G         C     Bm   Am           C     G   D
Between our love, our love, oh our love, our love
 
 
[Chorus]
 
G                             D/F#
Just give me a reason, just a little bit's enough
       Em                              Bm
Just a second, we're not broken, just bent
           D
And we can learn to love again
G                             D/F#                         Em
I never stopped, you're still written in the scars on my heart
                        Bm
You're not broken, just bent
           D                  Em
And we can learn to love again
 
 
[Verse 3]
 
Em                  Bm
Oh, tears ducts and rust
                C
I'll fix it for us
                 D
We're collecting dust but our love's enough
Em                Bm
You're holding it in, you're pouring a drink
C                 Am  Bm C  D  Dsus4
No, nothing is as bad as it seems
 
We'll come clean
 
 
[Chorus]
 
(no instrumental)
 
Just give me a reason
Just a little bit's enough
Just a second, we're not broken, just bent
And we can learn to love again
It's in the stars
It's been written in the scars on our hearts
We're not broken, just bent
And we can learn to love again...
 
 
[Chorus]
 
G                             D/F#
Just give me a reason, just a little bit's enough
       Em                              Bm
Just a second, we're not broken, just bent
           D
And we can learn to love again
G                            D/F#                        Em
It's in the stars, it's been written in the scars on our hearts
                        Bm
We're not broken, just bent
           D              G
And we can learn to love again
 
G  D/F#                     Em
Ohhh, we can learn to love again
       Bm       D              G
Ohhhhh, we can learn to love again
D/F#  Em
    Ohh
Em                           Bm              D
That we're not broken, just bent and we can learn to love again

[Verse]
 
C                Am  E             G
 In the suburbs, I    I learned to drive
         C                     Am   E                   G
 And you told me we’d never survive, grab your mother’s keys, we’re leaving
C Am E G
 
C                     Am   E         G
 You always seemed so sure, that one day we’d be fighting
C              Am  E             G
 In a suburban war, your part of town against mine
           C                        Am    E           G
 I saw you standing on the opposite shore, but by the time the first bombs fell
 C               Am    E                 G
 We were already bored, we were already, already bored

 The kids wanna be so hard, but in my dreams we’re still screaming
     C                   Am   E                G
 And running through the yard, when all of the walls that they built
        C                 Am   E               G
 In the seventies finally fall, and all of the houses they built
        C                 Am                         E              G
 In the seventies finally fall, meant nothing at all, meant nothing at all, it meant nothing

 And into the night

C                      Am E             G
 So can you understand,    why I want a daughter 
                 C    Am        E                 G
 While I’m still young, I wanna hold her hand and show her some beauty
   C                       Am   E            G
 Before all this damage is done, but if it’s too much to ask
         C              Am               E    G
 If it’s too much to ask, then send me a son
C                  Am E               G
 Under the overpass,   in the parking lot we’re still waiting
      C             Am E             G
 It’s already passed,   so move your feet from hot pavement
     C              Am                    E                   G
 And into the grass,  'cause it’s already past, it’s already, already past

C            Am               E           D
 Sometimes I can’t believe it, I’m moving past the feeling

 Sometimes I can’t believe it, I’m moving past the feeling
  C   Am E           D
 Again,   I'm moving past the feeling

      I’m moving past the feeling

F                         C
It's been seven hours and fifteen days
Dm                             F  C
since you took your love away
F                        C
I go out every night and sleep all day
Dm                             F  C
since you took your love away
F                                C
Since you been gone I can do whatever I want
Dm                           F  C
I can see whomever I choose
 
 
[Chorus]
 
F                              C
I can eat my dinner in a fancy restaurant
    Dm                                A7
but nothing, I said nothing can take away these blues
     Eb         Bb
'cos nothing compares
Dm         C
nothing compares 2 U
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
F                       C
It's been so lonely without U here
Dm                         F  C
like a bird without a song
F                               C
nothing can stop these lonely tears from falling
          Dm                 Bb
tell me baby where did I go wrong?
F                                C
I could put my arms around every boy I see
     Dm                      C
but they only remind me of U
 
 
[Chorus]
 
F                                         C
I went to the doctor and guess what he told me guess what he told me
            Dm                                      A7
he said: ""girl U better try to have fun no matter what U do""

All the flowers that U planted mama

in the back yard
                           F     C
all died when U went away
 
 
[Chorus]
 
F                                   C
I know that living with U baby was sometimes hard
Dm                                 A7

Nothing Personal
Therapy
Tuning: DROP D
If you're playing with two guitarists
then just one guitar needs to be drop D,
the distorted one. The one that plays the
arpeggios can be standard, but the tabs here
are all for drop D.
 
 
[Intro]
          A                  D             F#m       E            D

[Verse]
(Same pattern. Start strumming on the *F#m)
 
   A                   D
My ship went down in a sea of sound
       F#m     E         D
When I woke up alone I had everything
  A                    D
A handful of moments I wished I could change
      F#m           E            D
And a tongue like a nightmare that cut like a blade
     A                   D
In a city of fools I was careful and cool
         F#m      E          D
But they tore me apart like a hurricane
  A
A handful of moments 
  D                             *F#m E   D
I wish I could change but I was carried away
 
 
[Chorus]
 
         A
Give me therapy
      E            F#m
I'm a walking travesty
        D
But I'm smiling at everything
A                 E                 F#m
Therapy, you were never a friend to me
            D
And you can keep all your misery.
 
          A                  D             F#m       E            D

[Verse 2]
(Same pattern above)
 
   A
My lungs gave out
     D
As i faced the crowd
             F#m          E           D
I think that keeping this up could be dangerous
    A
I'm flesh and bone
       D
I'm a rolling stone
        F#m     E         D
and the experts say I'm delirious
 
 
[Chorus]
(powerchords)
 
         A
Give me therapy
      E            F#m
I'm a walking travesty
        D
But I'm smiling at everything
A                 E                 F#m
Therapy, you were never a friend to me
            D
And you can take back your misery
 
 
[Bridge]
 
Bm                     A
Arrogant boy, love yourself so no one has to
        E
They're better off without you
         E4             E
(They're better off without you)
Bm                    A
Arrogant boy, cause a scene like you're supposed to
        F#m
They'll fall asleep without you
       D                       A
You're lucky if your memory remains
 
 
[Chorus]
 
         A
Give me therapy
      E            F#m
I'm a walking travesty
        D
But I'm smiling at everything
 
A                 E                 F#m
Therapy, you were never a friend to me
            D
And you can take back your misery
A
Therapy
      E            F#m

Shouldn't a light go on?
G              D                  A            Em   G
Doesn't he know that I've had him memorized for so long

Never let nobody see him cry

I'm holding every breath for you

He'd never tell you

But he can play guitar
                Em
I think he can see through
               G
Everything but my heart 
                      D
First thought when I wake up is

My God, he's beautiful

His favorite color's green

He loves to argue

Oh, and it kills me

His sister's beautiful
            A
He has his father's eyes

  Double cross the vacant and the bored,
A                                       Emaj7   E
  They're not sure just what we have in store.
A                         F#          A
  Morphine city slippin' dues down to see:
 
[Chorus 2]
     E        Emaj7 Amaj7                  E
That we don't even  care as restless as we are,
   Emaj7    Amaj7                          E
We feel the pull in the land of a thousand guilts.
    Emaj7    Amaj7
And poured cement,
               B
Lamented and assured.
 
[Bridge]
                  C#m     A
To the lights and towns below,
B               C#m      A
Faster than the speed of sound,
B              C#m          A    F#m7      B        Emaj7   E
Faster than we thought we'd go beneath the sound of hope.
 
[Verse 4]
A                        Emaj7   E
  Justine never knew the rules,
A                               Emaj7   E
  Hung down with the freaks and ghouls.
    A                      Emaj7   E
No a-pologies ever need be made,
A                            F#m7       B
  I know you better than you fake it to see:
 
[Chorus 3]
     E        Emaj7 Amaj7                      E
That we don't even  care to shake these zipper blues,
    Emaj7    Amaj7                          E
And we don't know just where our bones will rest
   Emaj7  Amaj7
To dust I guess,
                F#m             B       Emaj7   E
Forgotten and absorbed into the earth below.
 
[Outro]
A                                 Emaj7   E
  The street heats the urgency of now.
A                            E
  As you see there's no one around.

You was at the mall wit' yo' friend

I was scared to approach ya, but then you came closer
G                          D
Hopin' you would give me a chance

We talk on the phone, from night 'til the morn'
G                           D

This is the version off the album. Best to play it with bar chords.
The Gmaj7 isn't exactly right, but the tab at the beginning is, so just play that
chord the whole time for it. Enjoy!

           G                                    Gmaj7 [3 5 4 4 3 3]
Was it you who spoke the words that things would happen but not to me
       Em
Oh things are gonna happen naturally
       Am
Oh taking your advice and I'm looking on the bright side 
     C                  D/F#
And balancing the whole thing
        G                                  Gmaj7
Oh but often times those words they get tangled up in lines
         Em
And the bright light turns to night
      Am
Oh until the dawn it brings another day to sing
           C                     D/F#
About the magic that was you and me
 
 
                G         Gmaj7
Cause you and I both loved
           D/F#   Em
What you and I spoke of 
                 Am
And others just read of
             C           D
Others only read of the love
                    G   Gmaj7
Of the love that I love 
 Em
yeah la-be-de-dum
 
 
                       G
See I'm all about them words
     Gmaj7                          Em
Over numbers, unencumbered numbered words
                                   Am
Hundreds of pages, pages, pages forwards
                           C                    D/F#
More words than I had ever heard and I feel so alive
 
 
                 G        Gmaj7
Cause you and I both loved
                Em

And if you could see me now oh love love

You and I you and I
 Gmaj7                  D/F#    Em
Not so little you and I      anymore
 
    Am
And with this silence brings a moral story 
                  C                         D/F#
more importantly evolving is the glory of a boy
                 G         Gmaj7
Cause you and I both loved

And if you could see me now

[Verse 1]
          G
I was walking down the street,
               Bb
When out the corner of my eye
          C                   Bb      F
I saw a pretty little thing approaching me.
                G
She said ""I've never seen a man
      Bb
Who looks so all alone,
            C          Bb    F
Could you use a little company?
        G
If you pay the right price
       Bb
Your evening will be nice,
            C                 Bb     F
And you can go and send me on my way.""
                 G
I said ""You're such a sweet young thing
        Bb
Why you do this to yourself?""
      C               Bb                F
She looked at me and this is what she said,
 
[Chorus]
 G                                 Bb C F
""Oh, there ain't no rest for the wicked,
 G                  Bb C F
Money don't grow on trees.
   G
I got bills to pay,
       Bb C F
I got mouths to feed,
             G                       Bb C F
There ain't nothing in this world for free.
         G
I know I can't slow down,
   Bb C F
I can't hold back,
            G                  Bb C F
Though you know, I wish I could.
          G                      Bb C F
No there ain't no rest for the wicked,
         G                    Bb C F
Until we close our eyes for good"".
 
[Verse 2]
          G
Not even fifteen minutes later
               Bb
I'm still walking down the street,
          C                   Bb      F
When I saw a shadow of a man creep out of sight.
                G
Then he walks up from behind
      Bb
And puts a gun up to my head,
            C          Bb    F
He made it clear he wasn't looking for a fight.
               G
He said ""Give me all you've got
      Bb
I want your money not your life,
            C          Bb    F
But if you try to make a move I won't think twice.""
               G
I said ""You can have my cash
      Bb
But first you know I got to ask
            C          Bb    F
What made you want to live this kind of life?""
 
[Chorus]
 G                                 Bb C F
He said ""There ain't no rest for the wicked,
 G                     Bb C F
Money don't grow on trees.
   G
I got bills to pay,
       Bb C F
I got mouths to feed,
            G                       Bb C F
There ain't nothing in this world for free.
         G
I know I can't slow down,
   Bb C F
I can't hold back,
            G                  Bb C F
Though you know, I wish I could.
          G                      Bb C F
No there ain't no rest for the wicked,
         G                    Bb C F
Until we close our eyes for good"".
 
[Verse 3]
          G
Now a couple hours passed
               Bb
And I was sitting at my house,
            C          Bb    F
The day was winding down and coming to an end.
          G
So I turned on the TV
               Bb
And flipped it over to the news,
            C          Bb    F
And what I saw I almost couldn't comprehend.
        G                                 Bb
I saw a preacher man in cuffs, he'd taken money from the church,
                 C                                  Bb    F
He'd stuffed his bank account with righteous dollar bills.
               G
But even still I can't say much
               Bb
Because I know we're all the same,
            C          Bb    F
Oh yes we all seek out to satisfy those thrills.
 
[Chorus]
               G                     Bb C F
You know there ain't no rest for the wicked,
 G                  Bb C F
Money don't grow on trees.
   G
We got bills to pay,
       Bb C F
We got mouths to feed,
             G                       Bb C F
There ain't nothing in this world for free.
         G
Oh no we can't slow down,
   Bb C F
We can't hold back,
            G                  Bb C F
Though you know, we wish we could.
          G                      Bb C F
No there ain't no rest for the wicked,
         G                    Bb C F
Until we close our eyes for good

2007 Update:
Since transcribing this song, I've seen it in Guitar World Magazine,
GuitarOne Magazine, and Guitar Techniques Magazine - it looks as though
my transcription is EXACTLY the same as in the Magazines (they ALL have
the same chords as me, so I guess my transcription must be accurate :)

Nickelback - How You Remind Me
Drop-D Tuning D-A-D-G-B-E
 
[VERSE 1]
 
Csus2              Csus4/F
Never made it as a wise man
Bbsus2                 Bbsus4/Eb
I couldn't cut it as a poor man stealing
Csus2                  Csus4/F
Tired of living like a blind man
Bbsus2                      Bbsus4/Eb
I'm sick of sight without a sense of feeling
Csus2      Eb           Bb6sus2
And this is how you remind me
Csus2   Csus4/F      Bbsus2        Bbsus4/Eb
This is how you remind me of what I really am
Csus2   Csus4/F     Bb5           Eb5
This is how you remind me of what I really am
 
 
[CHORUS]
 
C5               Eb5         Bb5                    F5
It's not like you to say sorry, I was waiting on a different story
C5         Eb5         Bb5               F5
This time I'm mistaken for handing you a heart worth breaking
C5              Eb5            Bb5                    F5
I've been wrong, I've been down, been to the bottom of every bottle
C5              Eb5         Bb5            F5
These five words in my head scream ""are we havin' fun yet?""
C5    Fsus2  Bb5            Ebsus2  Csus2   (x2)
Yeah,   yeah,   yeah,   no,   no

I said I love you and I swear I still do

And it must have been so bad

G
Took a deep breath in the mirror
He didn't like it when I wore high heels

Turn the lock and put my headphones on
He always said he didn't get this song

G
Walked in expecting you'd be late
But you got here early and you stand and wave
  Cadd9
I walk to you

You pull my chair out and help me in
And you don't now how nice that is
    Cadd9
But I do
 
 
[Chorus]
 
Cadd9                                        Dsus4
 And you throw your head back laughin' like a, little kid
Em7
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny cause,
G
He never did
Cadd9
And I've been spending the last eight months

Thinkin' all love ever does is

And we walk down the block to my car
And I almost brought him up
    Cadd9                       Dsus4
But you start to talk about the movies 
                         Cadd9
That your family watches, every single Christmas

[Outro]
 
Cadd9                                          Dsus4
 Cause you throw your head back laughin' like a, little kid
Em7
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny cause,
G
He never did
Cadd9
And I've been spending the last eight months
Dsus4
Thinkin' all love ever does is 
G          D/F#      Em7
Break, and burn, and end
Cadd9                        Dsus4
But on a Wednesday in a cafe
                        G D/F# Em7 G/B
I watched it begin again
 
 
Cadd9                       D -once
But on a Wednesday in a cafe
I watched it begin again

Why are there so many songs about rainbows,
    G             Em    C    D
and what's on the other side?
G            Em           C     D
Rainbows are visions, but only illusions.
    G             Em         C
And rainbows have nothing to hide.

I've heard them calling my name.

[Verse 1]
                     E       F#
These mist covered mountains

Are home now for me
        D#m/A#       G#m     D#m
But my home is the low lands

And always will be

Someday you'll return to

Your valleys and your farms

Baptisms of fire
      D#m/A#        G#m      D#m
I've witnessed your suffering

As the battle raged higher

And though they did hurt me so bad

There's so many different worlds

So many different suns

[Verse 1]
    A*
I'm sitting in the railway station
      C#m/G#                C#dim/G  F#
Got a ticket for my destination,  mm-mmm
Bm                                G
On a tour of one-night stands, my suitcase and guitar in hand
    A                                  E                  A
And ev'ry stop is neatly planned for a poet and one-man band
 
 
[Chorus]
(A)      D              A
Homeward bound, I wish I was
         D
Homeward bound
A              Bm       A G D/A
Home where my thought's escaping
A             Bm A    G  D/A
Home where my music's playing
A             Bm   A    G  D/A
Home where my love lies waiting
E           A
Silently for me
 
 
[Verse 2]
A*
Every day's an endless stream
   C#m/G#               C#dim/G  F#
Of cigarettes and magazines,  mm-mmm
    Bm                                  G
And each town looks the same to me, the movies and the factories
    A                             E                        A
And every stranger's face I see reminds me that I long to be

Homeward bound, I wish I was
         D

Home where my thought's escaping

Home where my music's playing
A             Bm   A    G  D/A
Home where my love lies waiting

Silently for me
 
 
[Verse 3]
  A*
Tonight I'll sing my songs again,
     C#m/G#                C#dim/G  F#
I'll play the game and pretend,  mm-mmm
    Bm                              G
But all my words come back to me in shades of mediocrity
     A                      E                        A
Like emptiness in harmony I need someone to comfort me

(A)      D               A
Homeward bound, I wish I was

Home where my thought's escaping

Listen to the track for the strumming and picking techniques.
The strumming on the intro and middle verse is a little tricky to get right.

[Pre-Chorus]

[Verse 2]
 
E        G#                 A             F#m
Nobody I asked knew how he came to be the one to whom you surrendered

I tried to swim to the side

But my feet got caught in the middle
      E           G#       A     F#m
And I thought Id seen the light

But oh no,

[Verse 1]
 G                  Bm
On bended knee is no way to be free
G7                     C/E
Lifting up an empty cup, I ask silently
C                        G
All my destinations will accept the one that's me
D        Dsus2         D     Dsus4 D5
So I can breathe...
 
[Verse 2]
G                         Bm
Circles they grow and they swallow people whole
G7                                  C/E
Half their lives they say goodnight to wives they'll never know
C                          G
A mind full of questions, and a teacher in my soul
D          Dsus2         D     Dsus4 D5
And so it goes...
 
[Verse 3]
G                  Bm
Don't come closer or I'll have to go
G7                    C/E
Holding me like gravity are places that pull
C                        G
If ever there was someone to keep me at home
D          Dsus2         D     Dsus4 D5
It would be you...
 
[Verse 4]
G                      Bm
Everyone I come across, in cages they bought
G7                                 C/E
They think of me and my wandering, but I'm never what they thought
C                        G
I've got my indignation, but I'm pure in all my thoughts
D          Dsus2         D     Dsus4 D5
I'm alive...
 
[Verse 5]
G              Bm
Wind in my hair, I feel part of everywhere
G7                      C/E
Underneath my being is a road that disappeared
C                                  G
Late at night I hear the trees, they're singing with the dead
D          Dsus2         D     Dsus4 D5
Overhead...
 
[Verse 6]
G                   Bm
Leave it to me as I find a way to be
G7                      C/E
Consider me a satellite, forever orbiting
C                             G
I knew all the rules, but the rules did not know me
D          Dsus2         D     Dsus4 D5
Guaranteed

Bb                             Cm
  If the Lord don't forgive me
    Bb
I'd still have my baby and my babe would have me
Bb                             Cm
  When I was kissing on my baby
    Bb                                Cm
And she put her love down soft and sweet
Bb                            Cm
  In the low lamp light, I was free
Bb
Heaven and hell were words to me
 
 
[Chorus]
 
Gm          F
   When, my, time comes around
Bb                                Cm
   Lay me gently in the cold dark earth
Gm              F
   No grave can hold my body down
Bb
   I'll crawl home to her   
 
Gm          F
   When, my, time comes around
Bb                                Cm
   Lay me gently in the cold dark earth
Gm              F
   No grave can hold my body down
Bb
   I'll crawl home to her

A tornado flew around my room before you came

Excuse the mess it made, it usually doesn't rain in
Fmaj7                Em7
Southern California, much like Arizona

No I don't like you, I just thought you were cool enough to kick it
      Em7                              Am
Got a beach house I could sell you in Idaho
                        Fmaj7
Since you don't think I love you,
                        Em7
I just thought you were cute, that's why I kissed you

Got a fighter jet, I don't get to fly it though

Of course

How you feel?
           Dm7                   C
And though you were my first time
      G    Am
A new feel
                      Dm7
And it will never get old
                      C                    G      Am
Not in my soul, not in my spirit, keep it alive
                   Dm7
We'll go down this road
                   C                 G     Am
Til it turns from color to black and white

Say to the world

Oh, it turns me off

Oh, baby, don't care no more

I'm walking out that door
C
Well, I've been in town
 
For just 'bout fifteen minutes now

Oh, baby, I feel so down

        Em           Dm
I keep walking for miles
 
 
[Chorus]
 F                        G
But the people they don't understand
 F                          G
No, girlfriends, they can't understand

[Verse 1]
Am              E
From the dusty mesa
Dm                    Am
Her looming shadow grows
Am             E
Hidden in the branches
Dm              Am
of the poison creosote
 
Am
 
[Verse 2]
         C
She twines her spines up slowly
    G
Towards the boiling sun
     Dm
And when I touched her skin
      F
My fingers ran with blood
 
[Interlude]
Am Am Am Am Am Am
 
[Verse 3]
 Am         E
In the hushing dusk
          Dm            Am
Under a swollen silver moon
    Am          E
I came walking with the wind
    Dm               Am
To watch the cactus bloom
 
Am
 
[Verse 4]
    C
A strange hunger haunted me,
       G
The looming shadows danced
    Dm
I fell down to the thorny brush
     F
And felt a trembling hand
 
[Interlude]
Am Am Am Am Am Am
 
[Verse 5]
  Am                  E
When the last light warms the rocks
          Dm         Am
And the rattlesnakes unfold
  Am              E
Mountain cats will come
    Dm            Am
to drag away your bones
 
Am
 
[Verse 6]
      C
And rise with me forever
   G
Across the silent sand
         Dm
And the stars will be your eyes
         F
And the winds will be my hands

[Verse 1]
 
       G                   C
All my bags are packed I'm ready to go.
    G                C
I'm standing here outside your door.
  G                Am               D7
I hate to wake you up to  say good bye.
        G                   C
But the dawn is breaking it early morn.
    G                  C
The taxi's waitin he's blownin his horn.
 G              Am               D7
Already I'm so lonesome I could die.
 
 
[Chorus]
 
   G           C
So kiss me and smile for me.
 G                  C
Tell me that you'll wait for me.
G                   Am            D7
Hold me like you'll never let me go.
          G      C                G
Cause I'm leavin on a jet plane.
                C                   G
Don't know when I'll be back again.
    Am              D7
Oh, babe  I hate to go.
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
           G               C
There's is many times I've let you down.
   G              C
So many time I've played around.
  G            C                 D7
I tell you now they don't mean a thing.
      G               C
Every place I go I'll think of you.
      G                C
Ev'ry song I sing I'll sing for you.
     G                C                  D7
When I come back I'll bring your wedding ring.
 
 
[Verse 3]
 
G            C
Now the time come to leave you.
G             C
One more time let me kiss you.
     G               C             D7
Then close your eyes I'll be on my way.
G               C
Dream about the days to come.
     G               C
When I won't have to leave alone.
 G              C               D7
About the times I won't have to say...
 
 
[Chorus]
 
    G      C               G
I'm leavin on a jet plane.

Don't know when I'll be back again.

Oh, babe,  I hate to go.

[Verse 1]
C
The great protector
                             Em7
Is that what I'm supposed to be?
        Fmaj7
What if all this counts for nothing
                            F#m7b5
Everything I thought I'd be?
          G7
What if by the time I realize
          G7sus4         G7
It's too far behind to see?
C
Seventy-mil projector
                      Em7
I can show you everything, yeah
          Fmaj7
And we're on our way to glory
                          F#m7b5
Where the show won't ever end
        G7
And the encore lasts forever
         G7sus4            G7
And it's time we're due to spend
 
Fmaj9    Fmmaj9
 
[Verse 2]
C
Spending the years together
                    Em7
Growing older every day (Every day)
          Fmaj7
I feel at home when I'm around you
                     F#m7b5
And I'll gladly say again
           G7
I hope the encore lasts forever
            G7sus4         G7       Fmaj9
Now there's time for us to spend
                              Fmmaj9
And it's sublime with you, my friend
C
This right here still feels like a honeymoon
                Em7
When you say my name, nothing's changed
                          Fmaj7
I'm still a boy inside my thoughts
              F#m7b5        G7
Am I meant to understand my faults?
 
[Chorus]
                C
I don't think so
                                       Em7
I don't think I'm meant to understand myself
E7sus2    Fmaj7
Maybe you do
 
And that's good for you
F#m7b5   G7
Maybe in time
          G7sus4
Maybe one day
G7           C
I'll do the same
        Em7
ooo OOO ooo
 
(play verse chords for Ooos)...
 
             G7
(I'll do the same
            G7sus4
I'll do the same
G7
I'll do the
Fmaj7   Em7   Dm7   D7
same...
Gm7   F#maj7   Fmaj7
 
[Bridge]
            Fmaj7
I'll do the same as you
             Em7
I'll try and hold it up
       Dm7
Soon I hope
              D7             Gm7   Gbmaj7   Fmaj7
Or as soon as I'm old enough

Bb                                  Dm7  Dm7b5
Stay forever, you know more than anyone (Yeah, whoa)
         Cm7
And it's you that knows my darkness
 
And you know my bedroom needs
          Bbmaj7
You could blast me and my secrets
                                 Bb7
Because there's probably just no need

Well, I'm sure you could have made it that bit better on your own
 
[Verse 2]
       F              A7                        Dm
And I bet she told a million people that she'd stay in touch
      Cm                           Bb
Well, all the little promises they don't mean much
             Gm
When there's memories to be made
       F                   A7                 Dm
And I hope you're holding hands by New Year's Eve
      Cm                        Bb
They made it far too easy to believe
             Am                           Gm
That true romance can't be achieved these days
 
[Chorus]
Bb                               Bbm                        Am
And even if somehow we could have   shown you the place you wanted
          D7                                    Gm
Well, I'm sure you could have made it that bit better on your own

You are the only ones who know

[Verse 1]
G                    Bm
On bended knee is no way to be free
G7                         C/E
Lifting up an empty cup, I ask silently
C                         G
All my destinations will accept the one that's me
   D             Dsus2 D Dsus4
So I can breathe
 
[Verse 2]
G                           Bm
Circles they grow, and they swallow people whole
G7                                     C/E
Half their lives they say goodnight to wives they'll never know
  C                             G
A mind full of questions, and a teacher in my soul
    D          Dsus2 D Dsus4
And so it goes
 
[Verse 3]
G                    Bm
Don't come closer or I'll have to go
G7                          C/E
Holding me like gravity are places that pull
   C                         G
If ever there was someone to keep me at home
   D            Dsus2 D Dsus4
It would be you
 
[Verse 4]
G                          Bm
Everyone I come across, in cages they bought
     G7                                    C/E
They think of me and my wandering, but I'm never what they thought
     C                           G
I've got my indignation, but I'm pure in all my thoughts
D         Dsus2 D Dsus4
I'm alive
 
[Verse 5]
G                       Bm
Wind in my hair, I feel part of everywhere
G7                       C/E
Underneath my being is a road that disappeared
C                                       G
Late at night I hear the trees, they're singing with the dead
D        Dsus2 D Dsus4
Overhead
 
[Verse 6]
G                   Bm
Leave it to me as I find a way to be
   G7                      C/E
Consider me a satellite forever orbiting
C                             G
I knew all the rules, but the rules did not know me
D          Dsus2 D Dsus4
Guaranteed

Cmaj7 Cm        G                                 Cmaj7
Often I am upset that I cannot fall in love but I guess

Turn off your porcelain face, I can't really think right now and this place

Has too many colours enough to drive all of us insane

Cause I can feel ghosts and ghouls wrapping my head

Get a load of this monster

He doesn't know how to communicate

His mind is in a different place

Will everybody please give him a little bit of space

Get a load of this trainwreck

His hair's a mess and he doesn't know who he is yet

Welcome him with open arms

Song: Marry Me
Album: Tattoos
 
Simple chord progression, basically just G, D, Em and C throughout the whole song
except for slight changes during the bridge and outro.

G D Em C
 
 
[Verse 1]
 
G            D                       Em
  105 is the number that comes to my head
                 C                             G
When I think of all the years I wanna be with you
               D                      Em
Wake up every morning with you in my bed
                         C
That's precisely what I plan to do
 
 
[Pre-chorus]
 
         G                            D
And you know one of these days when I get my money right
         Em                              C
Buy you everything and show you all the finer things in life
        G                            D
We'll forever be in love, so there ain't no need to rush
     Em                                  C
But one day, I won't be able to ask you loud enough

[Verse two]
 
                       D                          Em
How many girls in the world can make me feel like this?
              C                 G
Baby I don't ever plan to find out
                      D                       Em
The more I look, the more I find the reasons why

You're the love of my life
 
 
[Pre-chorus]
 
         G                            D

I'll say will you marry me

I swear that I will mean it
          G       D     Em  C
I'll say will you marry me
 
 
[Bridge]
 
       Em
And if I lost everything
       D
In my heart it means nothing
         C
'Cause I have you, girl I have you
   Em
So get right down on bended knee
D
Nothing else would ever be
C
Better, better
    C
The day when I say

[Verse 1]
     G                                   D
They paved paradise and put up a parking lot
       G              A                 D
with a pink hotel, a boutique and a swingin' hot spot.

D               Dmaj7
Don't it always seem to go
         G/D                                  D
that you don't know what you've got till it's gone.

         G                    A                         D
and they charged the people a dollar and a half just to see 'em.
 
[Chorus]
D               Dmaj7
Don't it always seem to go
         G/D                                  D
that you don't know what you've got till it's gone.

They paved paradise and put up a parking lot.
 
[Interlude]

[Verse 3]
G                                     D
Hey farmer, farmer, put away that D.D.T. now,
        G                      A                          D
give me spots on my apples but leave me the birds and the bees, please.
 
[Chorus 3]
D               Dmaj7
Don't it always seem to go
         G/D                                  D
that you don't know what you've got till it's gone.

They paved paradise and put up a parking lot.
 
[Interlude]
D
 
[Verse 4]
G                                       D
Late last night I heard the screen door slam
      G               A                D
and a big yellow taxi took away my old man
 
[Chorus]
D               Dmaj7
Don't it always seem to go
         G/D                                  D
that you don't know what you've got till it's gone.
     G                  A                D     D
They paved paradise and put up a parking lot.

Don't it always seem to go
         G/D                                  D
that you don't know what you've got till it's gone.
     G                  A                D
They paved paradise and put up a parking lot.
 
[Outro]
D         G               A                D
Yeah they paved paradise, put up a parking lot

I said they paved paradise, put up a parking lot

Don't stop me, yes I'm having a good time, I don't want to stop at all
 
 
[Verse 3]
 
 
I'm a rocket ship, on my way to mars, on a collision course
I am a satellite, I'm out of control
I'm a sexmachine, ready to reload, like an atombomb
about to oh, oh, oh, oh, to explode
I'm burning through ....
 
 
[Break]
 
N.C.
Don't stop me, don't stop me, don't stop me, hey hey hey
N.C.
Don't stop me, don't stop me, oh oh oh
N.C.
Don't stop me, don't stop me, have a good time, good time
N.C.
Don't stop me, don't stop me, Ahhhhh
 
(Guitar)  =  verse
 
 
[Ending]
 
I'm burning through ...
 
Don't stop me now ...

Fall has come

Blue skies turning grey

Like my love

I try to carry you

And make you whole

Who’ll you blame?

[Verse 1]
         A
Blame it all on my roots
  Bbdim7
I showed up in boots
    Bm
And ruined your black tie affair
    E
The last one to know
    E7
The last one to show
          A
I was the last one you thought you'd see there
      A
And I saw the surprise
        Bbdim7
And the fear in his eyes
     Bm                      Dm7
When I took his glass of champagne
E
I toasted you
           E7
Said honey we may be through
    E
But you'll never hear me
    E7
Complain
 
[Chorus]

'Cause I got friends in low places

Where the whiskey drowns and the beer chases

My blues away

And I'll be okay
A
I'm not big on social graces
           A                    A7
Think I'll slip on down to the oasis

In low places
 
[Verse 2]
        A
Well, I guess I was wrong
  Bbdim7
I just don't belong
    Bm
But then, I've been there before
     E
Everything's alright
     E7
I'll just say goodnight
         A
And I'll show myself to the door
     A
Hey, I didn't mean
   Bbdim7
To cause a big scene
     Bm                  Dm7
Just give me an hour and then

I'll be as high as that

This song's chords are easy; however, it took a long time for this noob to
find the right way to palm mute and have the right strum pattern. It's a
great way to learn palm muting!

Am I loud and clear or am I breaking up?
                Em          G      Cadd9
Am I still your charm or am I just bad luck?
    Em         G              Cadd9           Dsus2
Are we getting closer, or are we just getting more lost?
              Em          G             Cadd9
I'll show you mine if you show me yours first

Let's unwrite these pages and replace them with our own words

We live on front porches and swing life away
   Em          G            Cadd9   Dsus2
We get by just fine here on minimum wage
   Em        G          Cadd9          Dsus2
If love is a labor I'll slave 'til the end
  Em                G             Cadd9       Dsus2
I won't cross these streets until you hold my hand

I've been here so long; think that its time to move
                Em            G    Cadd9
The winter's so cold summer's over too soon
   Em             G        Cadd9                  Dsus2
so let's pack our bags and settle down where palm trees grow
              Em                 G        Cadd9
I've got some friends, some that I hardly know
                   Em               G             Cadd9
But we've had some times I wouldn't trade for the world
               Em             G            Cadd9          Dsus2
We chase these days down with talks of the places that we will go

We live on front porches and swing life away

We get by just fine here on minimum wage

My eyes have always followed you around the room
    Dsus2           Am       C/G         G
Cos you're the only God that I will ever need
    Dsus2          Am                        C/G

G                   Em7
If I had a gun, I'd shoot a hole in to the sun
    G                    A7sus4        Em7
And love would burn this city down for you

A hundred days have made me older, Since the last time that I saw your pretty face,
           Bm                               A
A thousand lies have made me colder, And I don't think I can look at this the same
Bm                          A
An all the miles that separate,
Bm                           G               A
They Disappear now when I'm dreamin' of your face
 
[Chorus]
D                         A                                Bm
I'm here without you baby, But you're still on my lonely mind
                        G           A                   D
I think about you baby and I dream about you all the  time
                           A                              Bm
I'm here without you baby,  But you're still with me in my dreams,
       G               A           Bm
And tonight, there's  only you and me

The miles just keep rollin' As the people leave their way to say hello
                Bm                   A                                 Bm
I've heard this life is overrated But I hope that it gets better as we go,
     G     A
 ohh yeah yeah*

D                         A                                Bm

                        G           A                  D

                           A                              Bm
I'm here without you baby,  But you're still with me in my dreams,
      G                 A
And tonight girl, there's only you and  me
 
[Bridge]
Bm                D                   A
Everything I know, and everywhere I go
                          G
It gets hard but it won't take away my love
Bm                          D                            A
And when the last one falls, and when it's all said and done
                           G
It gets hard, but it won't take away my love, whoa oh

I'm here without you baby, But you're still on my lonely mind

I think about you baby and I dream about you all the  time
                           A                              Bm
I'm here without you baby,  But you're still with me in my dreams,
     G                   A             D      A         Bm      G     A              Bm
And tonight girl, there's only you and me    yeah   Ho_yeah, Ho-ooh-oh   oh, ho-ooh- oh

G                     D

G                      D
A guitar string to the strum

A beautiful song to be sung
D          G                      D

Play the music low and sway to the rhythm of love

Bob Dylan
 
Transcription (and any mistakes) by jwblair@ix.netcom.com
 
I figured this out a few years back when I bought the video
""Don't Look Back"". You see Dylan detune and some fingerings
when he plays ""Baby Blue"" for Donovan in the hotel. (By the
way, in ""Don't Look Back"" Dylan capos 2, but Donovan's guitar
is tuned 1/2 tone below concert, so capo 1 to play along
with the video.)
 
Bringing It All Back Home version
Capo 4, bottom E tuned down to C
 
Note-> CADGBe
       ++++++
C      032010
Cadd4  033010 (add the little finger on the 4th string)
G      220000 (actually an Em7, but this is what he plays for G)
F      003211
Dm     200231 (use the thumb to fret the 6th string)
E      x22100 (or maybe E7: x22130)
 
(Note: be sure to strum the 6th string to keep the distinctive
droning C note going.)
 
 
[Intro]
 
C and Cadd4
(hammering onto the 4th string at the 2nd fret)
 
 
[Verse 1]
 
G                                           F          C
You must leave now, take what you need, you think will last
        G                                 F       C
But whatever you wish to keep, you better grab it fast
Dm                 F               C
Yonder stands your orphan with his gun
Dm            F           C
Crying like a fire in the sun
E7                      F      G
Look out the saints are coming through
    Dm            F         C
And it's all over now, Baby Blue.
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
G                                     F          C
The highway is for gamblers, better use your sense.
        G                                 F       C
Take what you have gathered from coincidence.
Dm                 F               C
The empty-handed painter from your streets
Dm              F              C
Is drawing crazy patterns on your sheets.
    E7                   F     G
The sky, too, is folding under you
    Dm            F         C
And it's all over now, Baby Blue.
 
 
[Verse 3]
 
G                                        F          C
All your seasick sailors, they are rowing home.
        G                               F       C
Your empty handed armies, they're all going home.
Dm                 F               C
The lover who just walked out your door
Dm               F              C
Has taken all his blankets from the floor.
E7                      F      G
The carpet, too, is moving under you
    Dm            F         C
And it's all over now, Baby Blue.
 
 
[Verse 4]
 
G                                           F          C
Leave your stepping stones behind, something calls for you.
        G                                 F       C
Forget the dead you've left, they will not follow you.
Dm                 F               C
The vagabond who's rapping at your door
Dm               F              C
Is standing in the clothes that you once wore.
E7                      F      G
Strike another match, go start anew
    Dm            F         C
And it's all over now, Baby Blue.

  You know you don't belong

You're the first to fight, you're way too loud

[Verse 1]
 
B                                 F#m                   E
When I was younger I saw my daddy cry and curse at the wind.
   B                                                F#m         E
He broke his own heart and I watched as he tried to re-assemble it.
    B                                  F#m         E
And my mamma swore she would never let herself forget.
    B                                                  F#m
And that was the day that I promised I'd never sing of love if does not
E
exist. But darling...
 
 
[Chorus]
 
B
You are the only exception
F#m         E
You are the only exception
B
You are the only exception
F#m         E   B
You are the only exception
 
 
[Verse 2]
                                  F#m                  E
Maybe I know somewhere deep in my soul that love never lasts.
    B                                         F#m                    E
And we've got to find other ways to make it alone or keep a straight face.
    B                                       F#m        E
And i've always lived like this keeping a comfortable, distance.
    B                                          F#m           E
And up until now I swore to myself that I'm content with loneliness,
       B
'cause none of it was ever worth the risk.
 
 
[Chorus]
 
    B
But you are the only exception
F#m         E
You are the only exception
B
You are the only exception
F#m         E
You are the only exception

           C#m
I've got a tight grip on reality,
                B                        F#
But I can't let go of what's part of me here.
              C#m
I know you're leaving tomorrow, when you wake up,
         B                                  F#
Leave me with some kind of proof it's not a dream.
     E

  A lovestruck Romeo     sings the streets a serenade

Laying everybody low     with a love song that he made

  Finds a street light, steps out of the shade

Says something like...  you and me babe, how about it?

Juliet,   the dice was loaded from the start

And I bet,   and you exploded in my heart
      G   C          F      Am          F
And I forget, I forget    the movie song

  We come up on different streets,     and they were both streets of shame
                      G Am            F
Both dirty, both mean,    and yes the dream was just the same

Capo II
 
[Intro]
| E   | E   | E   | E   | x2
(E  E7 on upstroke if you listen to the recording, you'll get the idea!)
 
[Verse 1]
      E
I can see her lyin' back in her satin dress
     B7                       E
In a room where ya do what ya don't confess
 
[Chorus]
E             A
   Sundown ya better take care
     D                                E
If I find you've been creepin' 'round my back stairs
E             A
   Sundown ya better take care
     D                                E
If I find you've been creepin' 'round my back stairs
 
E
 
[Verse 2]
           E
She's been lookin' like a queen in a sailor's dream
        B7                        E
And she don't always say what she really means
 
[Chorus]
E              A
   Sometimes I think it's a shame
       D                           E
When I get feelin' better when I'm feelin' no pain
E              A
   Sometimes I think it's a shame
       D                           E
When I get feelin' better when I'm feelin' no pain
 
[Instrumental]
| E   | E   | E
 
[Verse 3]
      E
I can picture every move that a man could make
        B7                         E
Getting lost in her lovin' is your first mistake
 
[Chorus]
E             A
   Sundown ya better take care
     D                                E
If I find you've been creepin' 'round my back stairs

   Sometimes I think it's a sin

When I feel like I'm winnin' when I'm losin' again

[Verse 4]
      E
I can see her lookin' fast in her faded jeans
        B7                        E
She's a hard lovin' woman, got me feelin' mean
 
[Chorus]
E              A
   Sometimes I think it's a shame
       D                           E
When I get feelin' better when I'm feelin' no pain

   Sundown ya better take care
     D                                E
If I find you've been creepin' 'round my back stairs
E             A
   Sundown ya better take care
     D                                E
If I find you've been creepin' 'round my back stairs
 
E
 
E              A
   Sometimes I think it's a sin
       D                              E
When I feel like I'm winnin' when I'm losin' again

song I came up with for guitar hacks like myself that like to belt out a popular tune
without having to go through fifteen years of music theory. As for standard tuning,
drop tuning or capo the first fret thing...you can do any of the three as long as you
sing in that key. You see people I don't play along with the record and you won't be
able to either with this tab. I travel the route of least resistance to my musical
destination. There is more than one way to skin a cat people!
Play and Enjoy!
 
Capo 1
 
[Verse 1]
D                 Aadd11                               C6add9
Look at this Photograph, everytime I do it makes me laugh,
                        Gadd9                                   D
How did our eyes get so red, and what the hell is on Joey's head?

And this is where I grew up, I think the present owner fixed it up,
                             Gadd9                                      D
I never knew we ever went without,the second floor is high for sneakin' out.
D                           Aadd11                               C6add9
And this is where I went to school, most of the time had better things to do,
                                Gadd9                                D
Criminal record says I broke in twice, I must have done it half a dozen times.
D                           Aadd11
I wonder if it's too late, should I go back and try to graduate,
C6add9                                   Gadd9
Life's better now than it was back then, if I was them I wouldn't let me

in...
 
[Chorus]
            Gadd9
Oh Oh Oh... Oh God I!
D                                           Aadd11
Every memory of lookin out the back door, I had the photo album spread
                  C6add9
out on my bedroom floor, It's hard to say it, time to say it
Gadd9
Good-bye, Good-bye.
D                                                      Aadd11
Every memory of walkin out the front door, I found the photo of the friend
                   C6add9
that I was looking for, It's hard to say it, time to say it
Gadd9
Good-Bye, Good-Bye.
 
[Verse 2]
D                 Aadd11                               C6add9
Remember the old arcade? Blew every dollar that we ever made.
                          Gadd9                                   D
The Cops hated us hangin' out, they say somebody went and burned it down.

We use to listen to the radio and sing along with every song we'd know.
                                     Gadd9
We said someday we'd find out how it feels to sing to more than just the
         D
steering wheel.
D                       Aadd11                                     C6add9
Kim's the first girl I kissed. I was so nervous that I nearly missed.
                                 Gadd9
She's had a couple of kids since then. I haven't seen her since god knows
F6
when.
 
[Chorus]
          Gadd9
Oh Oh Oh... Oh God I!
D                                           Aadd11
Every memory of lookin out the back door, I had the photo album spread
                  C6add9
out on my bedroom floor, It's hard to say it, time to say it
Gadd9
Good-bye, Good-bye.
D                                                      Aadd11
Every memory of walkin out the front door, I found the photo of the friend
                             C6add9
that I was looking for, It's hard to say it, time to say it
Gadd9
Good-Bye, Good-Bye.
 
[Bridge]
D              Aadd11               F6
I miss that town, I miss their faces
                Gadd9          D
You can't erase, You can't replace it.
           Aadd11                F6
I miss it now. I can't believe it.
            Gadd9            D
So hard to stay. To hard to leave it.
D                       Aadd11                                          F6
If I could relive those days I know the one thing that would never change...

Oh Oh Oh... Oh God I!
D                                           Aadd11

Look at this photograph...every time I do it makes me laugh.

Every time I do it makes me.

Two headed boy

All floating in glass

The sun it has passed

Now it's blacker than black

I can hear as you tap on your jar

I am listening to hear where you are

Put on sunday shoes

And dance round the room to accordion keys
         C                         D
With the needle that sings in your heart
         C                         G
Catching signals that sound in the dark
         C                         G
Catching signals that sound in the dark

Now your eyes ain't moving now, they just lay there in their climb

     G           B
With pulleys and weights
   G      B        C              G
Creating a radio played just for two
       C                             D
In the parlor with a moon across her face
    C                            G
And through the music he sweetly displays
       C                        G
Silver speakers that sparkle all day

Made for his lover who's floating and choking with her hands across her face
           G            D             C
And in the dark we will take off our clothes

Now your eyes ain't moving now, they just lay there in their cli-i-i-i-imb
 
 
G          B

There's no reason to grieve 
    G              B                  C           G
The world that you need is wrapped in gold silver sleeves
     C                              D
Left beneath Christmas trees in the snow
           C                      G
And I will take you and leave you alone
         C                       G
Watching spirals of white softly flow
          C
Over your eyelids and all you did
                                       D
Will wait until the point when you let go

[Verse 1]
 
      G                              Em
Do you still feel younger than you thought you would by now
    Am                                 D
or, darling, have you started feeling old yet?
      G                                Em
Don't worry, I'm sure that you're still breaking hearts
                 Am                      D
with the efficiency that only youth can harness.
          G                      Em
And do you still think love is a laserquest?
     Am                            D
Or do you take it all more seriously?
               G                    Em
I've tried to ask you this in some daydreams that I've had,
                Am                       D
but you're always busy being make-believe.
 
 
[Chorus]
 
    C                              D
And do you look into the mirror to remind yourself you're there?
          G                                   C
Or have somebody's good-night kisses got that covered?
                                D                     C          G
When I'm not being honest, I'll pretend that you were just some lover.
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
G                              Em
Now I can't think of there without thinking of you,
 Am                          D
I doubt that comes as a surprise.
     G                             Em
And I can't think of anything to dream about,
Am                        D
I can't find anywhere to hide.
 
 
[Chorus]
 
          C                         D
And when I'm hanging on by the rings around my eyes
          G                    C
and I convince myself I need another.
                                      D                   C         G
And for a minute it gets easier to pretend that you were just some lover.
 
 
[Bridge]
 
G Em Am D
 
 
[Chorus]
 
          C                     D
When I'm pipe and slippers and rocking chair,
         G                    C
singing dreadful songs about summer.
                                        D                 C         Em
Will I have found a better method of pretending you were just some lover?
             C                          D                 C         G
Will I have found a better method of pretending you were just some lover?

D
She's got a smile that it seems to me

Reminds me of childhood memories

I'd hate to look into those eyes and see an ounce of pain

Where as a child I'd hide

And pray for the thunder and the rain to quietly pass me by

C       F               Am
I never thought I'd die alone

I laughed the loudest who'd have known?
              F              Am
I trace the cord back to the wall

No wonder it was never plugged in at all

This first version sounds much better, but is a little more difficult.

When she was just a girl,
F                C
She expected the world,
       Dm                 Bb
But it flew away from her reach,
       F               C
So she ran away in her sleep.
 
 
[Chorus]
           Gm        Bb
Dreamed of para-para-paradise,
F         C
Para-para-paradise,

Life goes on,

It gets so heavy,

The wheel breaks the butterfly.
Bb            F
Every tear, a waterfall.

In the night, the stormy night,

She closed her eyes.

In the night, the stormy night,

I know the sun's set to rise.

To say, ""I love you"" right out loud

Billy Ray was a preacher's son

And when his daddy would visit he'd come along
E
When they'd gather 'round and started talking
B7
That's when Billy would take me walking
A-through the back yard we'd go walking

Being good isn't always easy
A             E
No matter how hard I'd try
E
When he started sweet-talkin' to me

He'd come and tell me everything is all right
He'd kiss and tell me everything is all right
Can I get away again tonight

How well I remember
A
  The look was in his eyes
Stealin' kisses from me on the sly
B7
   Takin' time to make time
Tellin' me that he's all mine
E7
   Learnin' from each other's knowin'
Lookin' to see how much we've grown

He was the sweet-talking son of a preacher man)
 
(The only boy who could ever teach me
        Was the son of a preacher man)
A kiss-stealin' son of a preacher man
 
(The only one who could ever move me
Was the son of a preacher man)
 
(The only one who could ever groove me
Was the son of a preacher man)

[Verse 1]
Eb                Bb/D
There's a calm surrender

To the rush of day
Eb                 Bb/D

An enchanted moment

There's a time for everyone
Eb           Bb/D
If they only learn

That the twisting kaleidoscope

You may tune down your guitar to Eb to get the Eb in the bass.
This sounds more original but you have to change several chords
 
 
Play the Verse something like that (if you like):
 
    Eb           Bb/D

[Chorus]

Round my hometown
 Em                F
Ooh the people I've met

[Verse 2]
 
          Am                C/G           Em          F
I like it in the city when the air is so thick and opaque
       Am            C/G        Em            F
I love to see everybody in short skirts, shorts and shades
    Am              C/G         Em           F
I like it in the city when two worlds collide
     Am                  C/G          Em    F
You get the people and the government
  Am                    C/G       Em    F
Everybody taking different sides
 
 
[Bridge]

F *          G         F *                   G
Now here you go again, you say you want your freedom;
F            G             F      G    F
Well, who am I to keep you down?
          G                     F                G
It's only right that you should play the way you feel it;
    F             G         F
but listen carefully to the sound
 
        G                 F                    G
Of your loneliness like a heartbeat drives you mad
       F              G                  F    G
In the stillness of remembering what you had,
             F    G
and what you lost
             F    G
And what you had,
             F    G
and what you lost
 
    Fmaj7        G6                F      G
Oh, thunder only happens when it's raining
Fmaj7        G6                    F      G
Players only love you when they're playing
     Fmaj7           G6                 F  G
Say, women they will come and they will go
Fmaj7         G6                       F    G        F

Now here I go again, I see with crystal visions;

I keep my visions to myself

It's only me who wants to wrap around your dreams and;

have you any dreams you'd like to sell?

Dreams of loneliness like a heartbeat drives you mad

Artist: Flogging Molly
Album:  Drunken Lullabies
Track:  4
Tabbed by: Bob
 
 
Anytime when playing a ""D"" chord in this song, alternate it every
few strums by lifting the index finger
off the string and strumming. The new chord will look like this: (XX0032)
 
 
[Intro]
 
D
 
 
[Verse 1]
 
D
If I ever leave this world alive, 
G                                 D
I'll thank ya' for things you did in my life.
 
If I ever leave this world alive,
G                                      D
I'll come back down and sit beside your feet tonight.
           A
Wherever I am, you'll always be.
          Bm         G
More than just a memory.
     D               A       D
If I ever leave this world alive.
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
D
If I ever leave this world alive,
G                                    D
I'll take on all the sadness, that I left behind.
 
If I ever leave this world alive,
G                              D
The madness that you feel will soon subside.
          A
So in a word, don't shed a tear.
        Bm                    G
I'll be here when it all gets weird.
     D     A                  D     A

  Almost heaven,    West Virginia,
E                        D          A
  Blue Ridge Mountains, Shenandoah River.
A                    F#m
  Life is old there, older than the trees,
E                           D                A
Younger than the mountains, growin' like a breeze.
 
 
[Chorus]

Country roads, take me home

   Miner's lady, stranger to blue water.
A                  F#m
   Dark and dusty, painted on the sky,
E                            D              A
   Misty taste of moonshine, teardrop in my eye.

    I hear her voice, in the mornin' hour she calls me,

The radio reminds me of my home far away.

Great song, Great band
 
The chords are pretty much the same throughout but I would like to say
that although ive said the 3rd chord in the progression is (F#m) and this is how I
play it, sometimes it looks as though the guitar is playing a normal F# though its
still sung as if over a minor. :) Enjoy
 
 
[INTRO]
 
 
D - A - F#m - E
D - A - F#m - E
 
[Verse 1]
 
D          A         F#m    E
I was left to my own devices
D         A              F#m         E
Many days fell away with nothing to show
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
 
D                           A
And the walls kept tumbling down
                   F#m   E
In the city that we loved
D                          A
Great clouds roll over the hills
                       F#m  E
Bringing darkness from Above
 
 
[Chorus]
 
                      D
But if you close your eyes,
        A
Does it almost feel like
F#m                 E
Nothing changed at all?
                      D
And if you close your eyes,
        A
Does it almost feel like
F#m                E
You've been here before?
D                    A         E
How am I gonna be an optimist about this?
D                    A          E
How am I gonna be an optimist about this?
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
D              A              F#m         E
We were caught up and lost in all of our vices
D            A           F#m             E
In your pose as the dust settles around us
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
 
D                           A
And the walls kept tumbling down
                    F#m E
In the city that we loved
D                          A
Great clouds roll over the hills
                       F#m  E
Bringing darkness from Above
 
 
[Chorus]
 
                      D
But if you close your eyes,
        A
Does it almost feel like
F#m                 E
Nothing changed at all?
                      D
And if you close your eyes,
        A
Does it almost feel like
F#m                E
You've been here before?
 
 
D                    A         E
How am I gonna be an optimist about this?
D                    A         E
How am I gonna be an optimist about this?

[Bridge]
 
D              A
Oh where do we begin?
F#m                E
The rubble or our sins?
D              A
Oh where do we begin?
F#m                E
The rubble or our sins?
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
 
D                           A
And the walls kept tumbling down
                    F#m  E
In the city that we loved
D                          A
Great clouds roll over the hills
                       F#m  E
Bringing darkness from Above

Capo on 3rd fret
 
This song is actually much simpler than the other ways up here. I watched some live videos
and the guitar player plays this song with a capo on the 3rd fret. Since the guitar is so quiet
it’s kind of hard to tell exactly what he’s playing, so I kind of just followed the bass.
For playing by yourself on an acoustic guitar this works perfectly.

But the clocks held nine fifteen for hours
   Em        Am7

If I could save time in a bottle
    Gm6                          A7
The first thing that I'd like to do   - play riff in reg time
      Dm         Dm7      Bb       Gm7    Dm
Is to save every day till eternity passes away
        Gm              A7
Just to spend them with you
            D           Dmaj7
But there never seems to be enough time
   D6                D                   G       Gmaj7
To do the things you want to do once you find them
   Em7       A7             D            Dmaj7
[1 bar]   [3/4 bar] I've looked around enough to know

Help, I have done it again

Tabbed By Ben
 
UPDATE: I've made the chords line up a bit better with the words - and added an
Em in place of a G in the ""I could live without you"" bit, (but both sound fine to be
honest) and a chord chart.
 
Also as a few people have asked about strumming / picking patterns, I have uploaded a
video of my playing this:

Katie don't cry I know you're trying your hardest

Ocala is calling and you know it's haunting

but compared to your eyes
        Bm              D
nothing shines quite as bright
            G             A

It's not mine but I want it.    So...

Is just taking breaths to stay
                          A
Cause I know I'm good for something

[Verse 1]
E
  I can see you standing, honey
C#m
  With his arms around your body
E                                         C#m
  Laughin', but the joke's not funny at all
E
  And it took you five whole minutes
C#m
  To pack us up and leave me with it
E                                         C#m
  Holdin' all this love out here in the hall
 
 
[Chorus]
A              B                C#m
  I think I've seen this film before
      B
And I didn't like the ending
A               B           C#m
  You're not my homeland anymore
   B                   A
So what am I defending now?
            B                C#m               E
You were my town, now I'm in exile, seein' you out
A              B                C#m
  I think I've seen this film before
E    C#m  E  C#m
  Ooh, ooh, ooh
 
 
[Verse 2]
E
  I can see you starin', honey
C#m
  Like he's just your understudy
E                                           C#m
  Like you'd get your knuckles bloody for me
E
  Second, third, and hundredth chances
C#m
  Balancin' on breaking branches
E                                C#m
  Those eyes add insult to injury

So who am I offending now?

You were my crown, now I'm in exile, seein' you out

Of crying I can do for you
         E
All this time

We always walked a very thin line
                        B
You didn't even hear me out (You didn't even hear me out)
                         A
You never gave a warning sign (I gave so many signs)
         E
All this time
                             C#m
I never learned to read your mind (Never learned to read my mind)

I couldn't turn things around (You never turned things around)

  So many signs, so many signs
                        A
You didn't even see the signs

Integrity, faith and crocodile tears

 Trust me darlin', trust me darlin'

Perfect paradise

Tearing at the seams

     Bm                 Bm
Does happiness lie in a diamond ring

Oh I've been asking, for

             D            G                         Bm
She put him out like the burnin' end of a midnight cigarette
       A        D        G                              A
She broke his heart he spent his whole life tryin' to forget
    Bm                         A       D
We watched him drink his pain away a little at a time
       Bm                      A        D
But he never could get drunk enough to get her off his mind

Until the night
 
 
[Chorus 1]
             D                                  A
He put that bottle to his head and pulled the trigger
     Bm                        G
And finally drank away her memory
 D                                  A
Life is short but this time it was bigger
            Bm                             G
Than the strength he had to get up off his knees
      D                                  A
We found him with his face down in the pillow
  Bm                                        G
With a note that said I'll love her till I die
      D                              A
And when we buried him beneath the willow
       G                      Bm
The angels sang a whiskey lullaby

     A          D         G                                A
For years and years she tried to hide the whiskey on her breath

She finally drank her pain away a little at a time

clinging to his picture for dear life
    D                                A
We laid her next to him beneath the willow

While the angels sang a whiskey lullaby

         G                         Dm
When you left this town, with your windows down

With the cities on the signs

But you held your course to some distant war

In the corners of your mind

From the second time around

Album Zion
Song: Scandal Of Grace
 
 
Key: C
 
 
[Verse 1]
 
C
Grace, what have you done?
Am            F         C
Murdered for me on that cross
  C
Accused in absence of wrong
  Am              F        C
My sin washed away in Your blood
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
 
    Em           F           C
Too much to make sense of it all
  Em              F             C
I know that Your love breaks my fall
    G                     Am
The scandal of grace, You died in my place
      F
So my soul will live
 
 
[Chorus]
 
         C
Oh to be like You
                         G
Give all I have just to know You
                        F
Jesus there's no one beside You
                       C     F  Am  F
Forever the hope in my heart
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
C
Death, where is your sting?
     Am           F         C
Your power is as dead as my sin
    C
The Cross has taught me to live
    Am        F                C
And mercy, my heart now to sing
 
 
[Pre-Chorus 2]
 
    Em          F                  C
The day and its troubles shall come
  Em              F               C
I know that Your strength is enough
    G                     Am
The scandal of grace, You died in my place
      F
So my soul will live
 
 
[Chorus]
 
         C
Oh to be like You
                         G

Forever the hope in my heart
 
         C
Oh to be like You

Give all I have just to know You
                        F
Jesus there's no one beside You

Forever the hope in my heart
 
 
[Instrumental]

C  F  Am  F
 
 
[Bridge]
 
F        C
And it's all because of You, Jesus

It's all because of You, Jesus

It's all because of Your love

That my soul will live

We'll turn off our phones

We'll play Nintendo

Drinking until the world

We keep behind closed doors

Every time I see you, I die a little more

Stolen moments that we steal as the curtain falls

It'll never be enough

As you drive me to my house

I etched the face of a stopwatch
Am
On the back of a raindrop
E                                 F
And did a swap for the sand in an hourglass.
C                        Am
I heard an unhappy ending it sort of sounds like you're leaving
E                             F                           C

                              F                  Dm       Am
And sat in a back booth by the pamphlets and the literature on how to lose.
     F            G             C          E
Your waitress was miserable and so was your food.

Mysteries flashing amber go green when you answer but the red on the rest of

the questionnaire never changes.
C                                     Am
I heard the news that youre planning to shoot me out of a cannon.
E                             F                         C

[Verse 1]
Em             D/F#        G
   It can't be said I'm an early bird
           Am       C/B   C
It's ten o'clock before I say a word
                  D
Baby, I can never tell
                    B7
How do you sleep so well?
 
                       Em
You keep telling me to live right
         D/F#           G
To go to bed before the daylight
             Am      C/B     C
But then you wake up for the sunrise
                            G
You know you don't gotta pretend
              D/F#
Baby, now and then
 
[Pre-Chorus 1]
                     Em
Don't you just wanna wake up, dark as a lake?
    D/F#        G
Smelling like a bonfire, lost in a haze?
   Am           C/B C
If you're drunk on life, babe, I think it's great
                  D
But while in this world
 
[Chorus]
             B7              Em
I think I'll take my whiskey neat
                D/F#   G
My coffee black and my bed at three

I aim true and the ground's where I go

I work late where I'm free from the phone
 
And the job gets done
        D             B7
But you worry some, I know
 
                         Em
But who wants to live forever, babe?

You treat your mouth as if it's Heaven's gate
            Am       C/B        C
The rest of you like you're the TSA

I wish I could go along, babe, don't get me wrong

You know you're bright as the morning, as soft as the rain

Pretty as a vine, as sweet as a grape
           Am  C/B  C
If you can sit in a barrel, maybe I'll wait

Until that day

   Before the story begins,     is it such a sin,

   For me to take what's mine,    until the end of time?
Dm                           A/C#
   We were more than friends,     before the story ends,

   And I will take what's mine, create what God would never design

apologize from somewhere far beyond the grave

https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/obadiah-parker/hey-ya-chords-772495,beginner,E A D G B E,4th fret,"['F', 'C', 'G', 'Am']","Obadiah does a very simple rhythm to this version and it's not very hard to follow along.
That being said he does the ""Shake it up"" part a different amount of times in the versions
I've found. So do as many as you'd like! And at the end of the song just fade out with soft strumming.
 
 
[Verse 1]
 C            F
My baby don't mess around
 
Because she loves me so
    G               Am
And this I know for sure
 C            F
But does she really wanna
 
But can't stand to see me
     G       Am
Walk out the door
 C               F
I can't stand to fight the feeling
                                     G        Am
Because the thought alone is killing me right now
    C             F
But thank God for Mom and Dad
 
For sticking two together
       G            Am
Cause we don't know how

You think you've got it
F
Oh, you think you've got it
 
But got it just don't get it
             G          Am
'Til there's nothing at all
C
We get together
F
Oh, we get together
                                  G                Am
But separate's always better when there's feelings involved
 
C                    F
If what they say is ""Nothing is forever.""
    G                Am
Oh, then what makes, then what makes, then what makes
 
Then what makes, what makes love the exception?
C
So why oh, why oh
F
Why oh, why oh, why oh, are we so in denial
G                       Am
When we know we're not happy here
 
 
[Chorus]

And, hey ya

Hey ya

And, hey ya

Hey ya

And, hey ya
 
G   Am
Hey ya
 
     C   F
And, hey ya
 
G   Am
Hey ya

Don't make me break it down for nothing
G        Am                                 C  F
I wanna see y'all on y'all's baddest behavior

Shake it shake it
            Am
Shake shake, shake shake it
 
Like a Polaroid picture
 
C
Oh now, shake it up

Oh now, but shake it up
 
I said shake it up
 G            Am
Shake it up, but oh now just shake it up
 
 
[Chorus]

All five horizons,

Give me a second I 
I need to get my story straight
     Am
My friends are in the bathroom
getting higher than the empire state

my lover she's waiting for me
just across the bar
              Dm
My seats been taken by some sunglasses
G
asking 'bout a scar
    C
and I know I gave it to you months ago
Am
 I know you're trying to forget
       F
but between the drinks and subtle things
the holes in my apologies
        Dm                         G
you know I'm trying hard to take it back

 Cause I found someone to carry me home

So will someone come and carry me home tonight

  E
Suzanne takes you down to her place near the river
        F#m
You can hear the boats go by, you can spend the night beside her
        E
And you know that she's half-crazy, but that's why you wanna be there
        G#m                                 A
And she feeds you tea and oranges that come all the way from China
        E                                   F#m
And just when you mean to tell her that you have no love to give her
         E                                   F#m
Then she gets you on her wavelength, and she lets the river answer
            E
That you've always been her lover
 
 
[Chorus 1]
        G#m                              A
And you want to travel with her, and you want to travel blind
        E                                  F#m
And you know she will trust you for you've touched her perfect body
          E
With your mind
 
 
[Verse 2]
    E
And Jesus was a sailor when he walked upon the water
       F#m
And he spent a long time watching from his lonely wooden tower
    E
And when he knew for certain only drowning men could see him
          G#m                            A
He said: ""All men will be sailors then until the sea shall free them""
    E                            F#m
But he himself was broken long before the sky would open
   E                       F#m
Forsaken, almost human, he sank beneath your wisdom
       E
Like a stone
 
 
[Chorus 2]
        G#m                              A
And you want to travel with him, and you want to travel blind
        E                                     F#m
And you think maybe you'll trust him for he's touched your perfect body
         E
With his mind
 
 
[Verse 3]
      E
Now Suzanne takes your hand, and she leads you to the river
       F#m
She is wearing rags and feathers from the Salvation Army counter
        E
And the sun pours down like honey on Our Lady of the Harbour
        G#m                               A
And she shows you where to look among the garbage and the flowers
         E                                 F#m
There are heroes in the seaweed, there are children in the morning
         E                                   F#m
They are leaning out for love, and they will lean that way forever

With her mind

[Intro] (Acapella)
 
Wait 'til you're announced
 
We've not yet lost all our graces
 
The hounds will stay in chains
 
Look upon your greatness
 
And she'll send the call out
 
Send the call out
 
 
[Verse 1]
 
C
   Call all the ladies out
C
   They’re in their finery
Am
   A hundreds jewels on throats
G
   A hundred jewels between teeth
C
   Now bring my boys in
C
   Their skin in craters like the moon
Am                       G
 The moon we love like a brother, while he glows through the room
 
 
[Bridge]
 
C
Dancin' around the lies we tell
C
Dancin' around big eyes as well
Am                G
 Even the comatose   they don’t dance and tell
 
 
[Chorus]
 
F                   Am
 We live in cities you'll never see on screen
G                         Em             Am
 Not very pretty, but we sure know how to run things
F             Am                            G
 Living in ruins  of the palace within my dreams
                Am                     F
 And you know, we're on each other's team
 
 
[Bridge]
 
             Am                              G
I'm kind of over getting told to throw my hands up in the air, so there
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
C
So all the cups got broke
 C
Shards beneath our feet
 Am                      G
But it wasn't my fault
 C                         C                      Am
And everyone's competing for a love they won't receive
                    G
'Cause what this palace wants is release
 
 
[Chorus]
 
F                   Am
 We live in cities you'll never see on screen
G                         Em             Am
 Not very pretty, but we sure know how to run things

 And you know, we're on each other's team
 
 
[Bridge]
 
F             Am                             G
 I’m kind of over getting told to throw my hands up in the air
 
So there
F            Am                     G
 I’m kinda older than I was when I revelled without a care
 
So there

C
 We broke up a month ago
       Am
Your friends are mine
                             Dm
You know I know you've moved on
       Dm
Found someone new
          G7
One more girl who brings out the better in you
    C
And I thought my heart was detached
     Am
From all the sunlight of our past
     Dm
But she's so sweet,
 Dm
She's so pretty
 G7
Does she mean you forgot about me?
 
[Chorus]
       C
Oh, I hope you're happy
    Am
But not like how you were with me
     Dm
I'm selfish, I know

I can't let you go

So find someone great but don't find no one better

                                               Dm
An eternal love bullshit you know you'll never mean

Remember when I believed

You meant it when you said it first to me
     C
And now I'm picking her apart

Like cutting her down, will make you miss my wretched heart

Di naman sinasadya
      G
Sinubukan ko naman

Na pigilan nalang
    Em
Pero ikaw ang gusto ko
     C
Isisigaw ko sa mundo
          G     D
Mahal kita...

Mahal kita...
Mahal kita...

From a lifetime of smiles

For one long last wine

We pray for blessings

We pray for peace

We pray for Your mighty hand to ease our suffering

As if every promise from Your Word is not enough

The pain reminds this heart That this is not

This is not our home

Or the aching of this life

Is the revealing of a greater thirst this world can't satisfy

What if trials of this life, the rain, the storms, the hardest nights

Are your mercies in disguise

To the town of Agua Fria rode a stranger one fine day
        C                                                  Am
Hardly spoke to folks around him, didn't have too much to say
        F                                 C
No one dared to ask his business, no one dared to make a slip
                                           Am
for the stranger there amongst them had a big iron on his hip
 F               C
Big iron on his hip
 
 
[Verse 2]
        C                           Am
It was early in the morning when he rode into the town
         C                                             Am
He came ridin' from the south side slowly lookin' all around
         F                                 C
He's an outlaw loose and runnin' came the whisper from each lip
                                            Am
And he's here to do some business with the big iron on his hip
 F               C
big iron on his hip
 
 
[Verse 3]
         C                                Am
In this town there lived an outlaw by the name of Texas Red
      C                                                Am
Many men had tried to take him and that many men were dead
        F                             C
He was vicious and a killer though a youth of twenty four
                                        Am
And the notches on his pistol numbered one and nineteen more

One and nineteen more

Now the stranger started talking, made it plain to folks around
        C                                       Am
Was an Arizona ranger, wouldn't be too long in town
         F                           C
He came here to take an outlaw back alive or maybe dead
                                      Am
And he said it didn't matter, he was after Texas Red
 F           C
After Texas Red
 
 
[Verse 5]
         C                         Am
Wasn't long before the story was relayed to Texas Red
         C                                               Am
But the outlaw didn't worry, men that tried before were dead
        F                                 C
Twenty men had tried to take him, twenty men had made a slip
                                         Am
Twenty one would be the ranger with the big iron on his hip
 F               C
Big iron on his hip
 
 
[Verse 6]
     C                                Am
The morning passed so quickly, it was time for them to meet
        C                                              Am
It was twenty past eleven when they walked out in the street
            F                                 C
Folks were watching from their windows, everybody held their breath
                                    Am
They knew this handsome ranger was about to meet his death
 F                 C
About to meet his death
 
 
[Verse 7]
           C                                Am
There was forty feet between them when they stopped to make their play
         C                                               Am
And the swiftness of the ranger is still talked about today
       F                                   C
Texas Red had not cleared leather 'fore a bullet fairly ripped
                                          Am
And the ranger's aim was deadly with the big iron on his hip
 F               C
Big iron on his hip
 
 
[Verse 8]
        C                       Am
It was over in a moment and the folks had gathered round
       C                                             Am
There before them lay the body of the outlaw on the ground
        F                                C
Oh, he might have gone on living but he made one fatal slip
                                            Am
When he tried to match the ranger with the big iron on his hip
 F               C
Big iron on his hip
 
 
[Outro]
     F        C
Big iron, big iron
         C                                  Am
When he tried to match the ranger with the big iron on his hip
 F               C
Big iron on his hip

   G        F      G
We all came out to Montreux
            F      G
On the Lake Geneva shoreline
        F              G
To make records with a mobile
          F         G
We didn't have much time
 
G     F             G
Frank Zappa and the Mothers
                 F      G
Were at the best place around
         F             G
But some stupid with a flare gun
                 F      G
Burned the place to the ground
 
C            G#         G
Smoke on the water, and fire in the sky
C            G#   G Bb C  G Bb D C  G Bb C  Bb G  2x
Smoke on the water
 
     G               F        G
They burned down the gambling house
                F     G
It died with an awful sound
                           F      G
A funky Claude was running in and out
             F        G
Pulling kids outa the ground
        F       G
When it all was over
                F      G
We had to find another place
                   F       G
But Swiss time was running out
                        F        G
It seemed that we would lose the race

We ended up at the Grand Hotel
             F        G
It was empty cold and bare
                                        F       G
But with the Rolling truck Stones thing just outside
           F     G
Making our music there
       F       G         F       G
With a few red lights, a few old beds
          F        G
We made a place to sweat
                  F          G
No matter what we get out of this
                     F        G
I know, I know we'll never forget

[Verse 1]
     G                D/F#
Step one, you say we need to talk
    Em                  D/F#              G
He walks, you say sit down, it’s just a talk
             D/F#           Em
He smiles politely back at you
             D/F#             G
You stare politely right on through
               D/F#         Em
Some sort of window to your right
             D/F#             G
As he goes left and you stay right
              D/F#            Em
Between the lines of fear and blame
                   D/F#
And you begin to wonder why you came
 
[Chorus]
C               D/F#            Em
Where did I go wrong, I lost a friend
            G             D/F#
Somewhere along in the bitterness
C                   D/F#            Em
I would have stayed up with you all night

G                 D/F#
Let him know that you know best
Em            D/F#         G
After all you do know best
                 D/F#
Try to slip past his defense
Em               D/F#      G
Without granting innocence
           D/F#                Em
Lay down a list of what is wrong
                  D/F#
The things you've told him all along
G              D/F#
Pray to God he hears you

As he begins to raise his voice
    Em              D/F#                   G
You lower yours and grant him one last choice
                D/F#
Drive until you lose the road
   Em                         D/F#     G
Or break with the ones you've followed
           D/F#
He will do one of two things
Em               D/F#
He will admit to everything
G                      D/F#
Or he'll say he's just not the same
    Em                 D/F#
And you will begin to wonder why you came

No summer`s high, no warm  July,

No harvest moon to light one tender August night.

  No autumn breeze, no falling leaves,
DmM7       Dm                Gsus4  G        C     C*
  Not even time for birds to fly to southern skies.

No Libra Sun, no Hallo - ween,
   Cmaj7/G C                                   Dm
No giving  thanks to all the Christmas joy you bring.
DmM7          Dm    DmM7               Dm7
  But what it i-i-i-is, though old, so new.
DmM7           Dm         Dm7      Gsus4       G    C     C*
  To fill your heart like no three words could ever do.

[Intro]
D  Em  Bm  G
 
[Verse 1]
D                        Em
Do you ever feel like a plastic bag
Bm
Drifting throught the wind
G
Wanting to start again
 
D                           Em
Do you ever feel, feel so paper thin
Bm
Like a house of cards
G
One blow from caving in
 
D                           Em
Do you ever feel already buried deep
Bm
Six feet under scream
G
But no one seems to hear a thing
 
D                                         Em
Do you know that there's still a chance for you
Bm
Cause there's a spark in you
 
[Pre-Chorus]
G                       D                Em
You just gotta ignite the light
Bm              G
And let it shine
D                    Em
Just own the night
Bm                          G
Like the Fourth of July
 
[Chorus]
                                      D
Cause baby you're a firework
Em                                Bm          G
Come on show 'em what your worth
                         D           Em
Make 'em go ""Oh, oh, oh!""
                      Bm                     G
As you shoot across the sky-y-y

Baby you're a firework
Em                         Bm       G

You don't have to feel like a waste of space

You're original, cannot be replaced
D                          Em
If you only knew what the future holds
Bm                         G
After a hurricane comes a rainbow
 
D                                  Em
Maybe you're reason why all the doors are closed
Bm                                        G
So you can open one that leads you to the perfect road
D                                   Em
Like a lightning bolt, your heart will blow
Bm                                                    G

So I look in your direction

But you pay me no attention do you?

I know you don't listen to me
 
'Cause you say you see straight through me

Don't you?

       E
So you know how much I need you
                              B
But you never even see me do you?
       E                              B
And is this my final chance of getting you?

[Intro]
 
Em
Putting my defenses up 
      C
Cause I don't wanna fall in love 
     C                 D                         Em
If I ever did that, I think I'd have a heart attack 
 
 
[Verse 1]
 
C                               D
 Never put my love out on the line
                                Em
Never said yes to the right guy
                                     D
Never had trouble getting what I want
                                              C
But when it comes to you I'm never good enough 
 
                 D
When I don't care
                             Em
I can play him like a Ken doll
                  D
Won't wash my hair 
                                      C
Then make him bounce like a basketball 
                                   D
But you make me wanna act like a girl 
                                Em
Paint my nails and wear high heels
                                 D
Yes you make so nervous that I just can't hold your hand 
 
 
[Chorus]
 
               Em D
You make me glow 
                                C D
But I cover up, won't let it show 
          C
So I'm putting my defenses up 
      Em
Cause I don't wanna fall in love 
       C               D                       Em D
If I ever did that, I think I'd have a heart attack 
                            Em D
I think I'd have a heart attack
                               C
I think I'd have a heart attack 
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
                                      D
Never break a sweat for the other guys 
                                    Em
When you come around I get paralyzed 
                                 D
And every time I try to be myself 
                                      C
It comes out wrong like a cry for help
 
                  D
It's just not fair 
                                       Em
Brings more trouble than it all is worth
             D
I gasp for air 
                                      C
It feels so good, but you know it hurts 
                                    D
But you make me wanna act like a girl
                            Em
Paint my nails and wear perfume
                                 D
For you, make so nervous that I just can't hold your hand 
 
 
[Chorus]
 
               Em D
You make me glow 
                                C D
But I cover up, won't let it show 
          C
So I'm putting my defenses up

I think I'd have a heart attack 
 
 
[Bridge]
 
Em                 C
 The feelings got lost in my lungs
                        G
They're burning, I'd rather be numb
            C                   Em
And there's no one else to blame 
                     C
So scared I'll take off and run
                 G
I'm flying too close to the sun
                        C D
And I'll burst into flames 
 
 
[Chorus]
 
               Em D
You make me glow 
                                C D
But I cover up, won't let it show 
          C

[Verse]
 
     C
When the days are cold
        G
And the cards all fold
       Am
And the saints we see
        F
Are all made of gold
 
         C
When your dreams all fail
       G
And the ones we hail
       Am
Are the worst of all
        F                  C
And the blood's run stale
 
                      G
I want to hide the truth
                  Am
I want to shelter you
                   F
But with the beast inside
                      C
There's nowhere we can hide
 
                  G
No matter what we breed
                     Am
We still are made of greed
                   F
This is my kingdom come
                   C
This is my kingdom come
 
 
[Chorus]
 
                G
When you feel my heat
            Am
Look into my eyes
                     F
It's where my demons hide
                     C
It's where my demons hide
              G
Don't get too close
         Am
It's dark inside
                    F
It's where my demons hide
                     C
It's where my demons hide
 
 
[Verse]
 
N.C.
When the curtain's call
       G
Is the last of all
        Am
When the lights fade out
        F
All the sinners crawl
 
        C
So they dug your grave
        G
And the masquerade
          Am
Will come calling out
       F
At the mess you made
 
C                     G
Don't want to let you down
              Am
But I am hell bound
                       F
Though this is all for you
                       C
Don't want to hide the truth
 
                  G
No matter what we breed
                     Am
We still are made of greed
                   F
This is my kingdom come
                   C
This is my kingdom come
 
 
[Chorus]
 
                G
When you feel my heat
            Am
Look into my eyes
                     F
It's where my demons hide
                     C
It's where my demons hide
              G
Don't get too close
         Am
It's dark inside
                    F
It's where my demons hide
                     C
It's where my demons hide
 
 
[Verse]
 
                      G
They say it's what you make
                 Am
I say it's up to fate
                 F
It's woven in my soul
                  C
I need to let you go
 
                         G
Your eyes, they shine so bright
                     Am
I want to save that light
                    F
I can't escape this now
                  C
Unless you show me how
 
 
[Chorus]
 
                G
When you feel my heat
            Am
Look into my eyes
                     F
It's where my demons hide
                     C
It's where my demons hide
              G
Don't get too close
         Am
It's dark inside
                    F
It's where my demons hide
                     C
It's where my demons hide

[Verse 1]
G       D                            G
Well, I dreamed I saw the knights in armour coming,
       D                 G
Sayin' something about a queen
           D                    A
There were peasants singin' and drummers drummin'
        G                A
And the archer split the tree
            Bm              C
There was a fanfare blowin' to the sun
         G               C
that was floating on the breeze
D                     A
Look at Mother Nature on the run

I was lying in a burned out basement
       D               G
With a full moon in my eye
      D          A
I was hoping for replacement
         G                     A
When the sun burst through the sky
            Bm           C
There was a band playing in my head
      G                 C
And I felt like getting high
      D                       A
I was thinking about what a friend had said
      C                G
I was hoping it was a lie
D                       A
Thinking about what a friend had said

In the yellow haze of the sun

All around the chosen one

All in a dream, all in a dream

Flying mother nature's silver seed

C                     Am
  Did I disappoint you or let you down?

  Should I be feeling guilty or let the judges frown?
C                       Am

     D                  Em - D  G       D              A    D
That he should give his only son, to make a wretch his treasure

NO CAPO
 
I'm including two ways to play the chords, in case you can't take on the barre chords yet.
Feel free to mix and match; it sounds pretty good with open Dm and barred Bb, for example.
I'll also list the intro here separately, since you probably only need this part at the beginning.
 
[Intro]
 
- Alternate between these first two positions, hitting the A & D strings (5th & 4th).
- The third (right-most) one is optional. Play it just once, after #2 and before #1.
It's like a ""step"" between.
- It also sounds best if you're throwing in some muting with either hand, if you are able to.
 
      #1       #2       #3

      Dm
His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
              Bb                        C
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
             Dm
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
          Bb                  C
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting
          Dm
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
      Bb                            C
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
        Dm
He's choking, how? Everybody's joking now
             Bb                   C
The clock's run out, times up, over, blaoh!
 
       Dm
Snap back to reality, oh, there goes gravity
Bb                           C                         Dm
Oh, there goes Rabbit. He choked, he's so mad but he won't
                                             Bb
Give up that easy, no, he won't have it he knows
                            C                         Dm
His whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter he's dope
                                                    Bb
He knows that but he's broke, he's so stagnant he knows
                                 C
When he goes back to his mobile home, that's when it's
Dm
Back to the lab again, yo

This whole rhapsody better go capture this moment
      C
And hope it don't pass him
 
 
[Chorus]
 
            Dm
You better lose yourself in the music
                     Bb                           C
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go
            Dm
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
           Bb                         C
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
             Dm
You better lose yourself in the music
                    Bb                            C

[Verse]
 
      Dm
His soul's escaping, through this hole that is gaping
     Bb                    C
This world is mine for the taking, make me king
Dm                                            Bb
As we move toward a new world order, a normal life is boring
    C              Dm
But superstardom's close to post mortem
                      Bb
It only grows harder, homie grows hotter
C                              Dm
He blows. It's all over, these hoes is all on him
                           Bb                        C
Coast to coast shows, he's known as the Globetrotter lonely roads
               Dm
God only knows he's grown farther from home, he's no father
   Bb                   C
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
    Dm
But hold your nose cuz here goes the cold water
      Bb                     C
These hoes don't want him no more, he's cold product
     Dm
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
                      Bb                C        Dm
He nose dove and sold nada, so the soap opera is told it unfolds
                                    Bb
I suppose it's old partner, but the beat goes on
Dm
Da da dum, da dum da da da
 
 
[Chorus]
 
            Dm
You better lose yourself in the music
                     Bb                           C
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go

[Verse]
 
Dm
No more games, I'ma change what you call rage
          Bb                          C
Tear this motherfucking roof off like two dogs caged
      Dm
I was playing in the beginning, the mood all changed
           Bb                        C
I've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
      Dm
But I kept rhyming and stepped, writing the next cypher
Bb                      C
Best believe somebody's paying the pied piper
Dm                                   Bb
All the pain inside amplified by the fact
                 C               Dm
That I can't get by with my 9 to 5
                                      Bb
And I can't provide the right type of life for my family
      C                       Dm
Cause man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers
                           Bb               C
And it's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life
          Dm
And these times are so hard and it's getting even harder
          Bb                          C
Trying to feed and water my seed, plus teeter-totter
          Dm
Caught up between being a father and a prima donna
    Bb                            C
Baby mama drama's screaming on and too much for me to wanna
Dm
Stay in one spot, another day of monotony's
      Bb                          C
Gotten me to the point I'm like a snail
                 Dm
I've got to formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot
        Bb                       C
Success is my only motherfucking option, failure's not
Dm
Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got to go
  Bb                 C                       Dm
I cannot grow old in 'Salem's lot, so here I go it's my shot
                     Bb                           C
Feet fail me not, this may be the only opportunity that I got
 
 
[Chorus]
 
            Dm
You better lose yourself in the music
                     Bb                           C
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go
            Dm
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
                     Bb                           C
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo

The original song is sung by 3 singers - Mohammad Irfan, Arijit Singh & Saim Bhat.
There are 2 other versions already available on UG..
But I am posting another version which can be played with a capo on the 1st fret.
 
The Chords I played as:  Am , Em , F , G  (Consider these chords after placing Capo on 1st Fret)
Strumming Pattern: D--U-D-D-U---D--U-D-D-U and so on...
Can be played in simple way other than the 2 other available chords versions.

[Verse 1]
 
G                         D/F#             Em
It’s strange to think the songs we used to sing
                C             G           D/F# Em C
The smiles, the flowers, everything... is gone
G                 D
Yesterday I found out about you
Em            C               G       D/F# Em C
Even now just looking at you... feels wrong
Em                 C                       G
You say that you’d take it all back, given one chance
                  D               C       D
It was a moment of weakness and you said yes
 
 
[Chorus]
 
                   Em                     C
You should’ve said no, you should’ve gone home
                      D                           G
You should’ve thought twice before you let it all go
    D/F#                 Em                           C
You should’ve known that word, bout what you did with her
                  D
Would get back to me...
                     Em                         C
And I should’ve been there, in the back of your mind
               D             G
I shouldn’t be asking myself why
    D/F#         Em             C              A
You shouldn’t be begging for forgiveness at my feet...
                   C                D
You should’ve said no, baby and you might still have me

[Verse 2]
 
G                D/F#
You can see that I’ve been crying
Em                C                     G    D/F# Em C
And baby you know all the right things... to say
    G      D/F#       Em      C
But do you honestly expect me to believe
G        D/F#        Em  C
We could ever be the same
Em                           C              G
You say that the past is the past, you need one chance
                  D               C       D
It was a moment of weakness and you said yes
 
 
[Chorus]
 
                   Em                     C
You should’ve said no, you should’ve gone home

You should’ve thought twice before you let it all go
    D/F#                 Em                           C
You should’ve known that word, bout what you did with her
                  D
Would get back to me...
                     Em                         C
And I should’ve been there, in the back of your mind
               D             G
I shouldn’t be asking myself why
    D/F#         Em             C              A
You shouldn’t be begging for forgiveness at my feet...
                   C                D
You should’ve said no, baby and you might still have me
 
Em C G D
 
 
[Verse 3]
 
Em         C                           A
I can’t resist… before you go, tell me this
      C      D
Was it worth it…
       C
Was she worth this…
 
Em C      D  G   D/F# Em C D
Nooooo no... no, no,  no,  no...
 
 
[Chorus]
 
                   Em                     C
You should’ve said no, you should’ve gone home

                    G                 Cadd9
 Hoping one of those senior boys will wink at you and say
            Em7                    Cadd9   Cadd9
 You know I haven't seen you around, before
 
 
                   G
 'Cause when you're fifteen and
Em7                       D
 Somebody tells you they love you
                 Cadd9
 You're gonna believe them
                G
 And when you're fifteen
   D/F#                Em7               Cadd9
 Feeling like there's nothing to figure out
     Em7                    D
 Well count to ten, take it in
                         G                D/F# Cadd9
 This is life before you know who you're gonna be
D
 At fifteen
 
G Cadd9 Em7 Cadd9
 
G                            Cadd9
 You sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail
         Em7                        Cadd9
 And soon enough you're best friends
G                                Cadd9
 Laughing at the other girls who think they're so cool
          Em7                          Cadd9
 We'll be out of here as soon as we can
     G                               Cadd9
 And then you're on your very first date
                Em7                           Cadd9
 And he's got a car and you're feeling like flying
            G                             Cadd9
 And you're momma's waiting up and you're thinking he's the one
              Em7                            Cadd9
 And you're dancing round your room when the night ends
          Cadd9
 When the night ends
 
 
                   G
 'Cause when you're fifteen and
Em7                       D
 Somebody tells you they love you
                 Cadd9
 You're gonna believe them
                G
 And when you're fifteen
  D/F#                Em7                   Cadd9
 And your first kiss makes your head spin 'round
    Em7                           D
 But in your life you'll do things greater than
            G           D/F#     Cadd9
 Dating the boy on the football team
             D
 But I didnt know it at fifteen
 
G Cadd9 Em7 Cadd9 D
 
Cadd9          Em7              D
 When all you wanted was to be wanted
                            G                  D/F#      Cadd9 D
 Wish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now
 
 
G                              Cadd9
 Back then I swore I was gonna marry him someday
       Em7                            Cadd9
 But I realized some bigger dreams of mine
     G                 Cadd9              Em7
 And Abigail gave everything she had to a boy
                 Cadd9            Cadd9
 Who changed his mind and we both cried
 
 
                   G
 'Cause when you're fifteen and
Em7                       D
 Somebody tells you they love you
                 Cadd9
 You're gonna believe them
                G
 And when you're fifteen
  D/F#            Em7             Cadd9
 Don't forget to look before you fall
Em7                           D
 I've found time can heal most anything
                    G                  D/F#     Cadd9
 And you just might find who you're supposed to be
          Em7            D/F#        Cadd9
 I didn't know who I was supposed to be
D
 At fifteen
 
 
G Cadd9 Em7 Cadd9
         La la la la la
G Cadd9 Em7
 La la la la la
Cadd9       G       Cadd9
 Your very first day, take a deep breath girl
Em7                         Cadd9
 Take a deep breath as you walk through the doors

         F

I got tired of waiting,   wondering if you were ever coming around
             Am        F
My faith in you was fading
                         C           G
Then i met you on the outskirts of town and i said
  C
Romeo save me i've been feeling so alone
   G
I keep waiting for you but you never come
    Am
Is this in my head, i don't know what to think
    F                       G
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said
  D
Marry me Juliet you'll never have to be alone
   A
I love you and thats all I really know
   Bm

 And as we walked we were talking
             G                           Cadd9

The chords aren't really C F Am, but it's easier with short names.
I think they're Fmaj7, Am7, and I'm not sure about C.
I hear G played a few different ways, play whichever sounds good to you!
 
READ THE CHORD CHARTS. THIS IS ACCURATE.
If you rate it poorly, at least post a correction so I know why.
Don't tell me the second verse lyrics are wrong, they're not. Buy the CD.

 Say you're sorry

 That face of an angel

 Comes out just when you need it to

 As I paced back and forth all this time

 'Cause I honestly believed in you
 Am
 Holding on
      F
 The days drag on

 Stupid girl,
                                    G* (or 320003)
 I should have known, I should have known
 
 
                 C                        Am
That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairytale

I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet

Lead her up the stairwell

This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town

I was a dreamer before you went and let me down

Now it's too late for you
           F                    C (C)

C
 Maybe I was naive,

 Got lost in your eyes
     Am                       F
 And never really had a chance

 My mistake I didn't know to be in love

 You had to fight to have the upper hand

 I had so many dreams

 About you and me
       G
 Happy endings, now I know
 
 
                 C                        Am
That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairytale

I was a dreamer before you went and let me down

Am             G          F
 And there you are on your knees

 Begging for forgiveness, begging for me

 Just like I always wanted but I'm so sorry

I'm gonna find someone someday who might actually treat me well
          C                       Am
This is a big world, that was a small town
            F                    G
There in my rearview mirror disappearing now
         Am           G              F
And it's too late for you and your white horse
         Am           G              F                     C
Now it's too late for you and your white horse, to catch me now
 
 
F      Am
 Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa
F                 C
 Try and catch me now
  F Am
 Oh, it's too late
F            C
 To catch me now

D                                                 A
You're on the phone with your girlfriend, she's upset
                                         Em
She's going off about something that you said
                                       G
'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do
D                                       A
I'm in the room it's a typical Tuesday night
                                                Em
I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like
                                      G
And she'll never know your story like I do
 
 
    Em                      G
But she wears short skirts, I wear T-shirts
D                       A
She's cheer captain and I'm on the bleachers
Em                              G
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
                A
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time
 
 
             D
If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
A                                     Em
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
                G                   D
You belong with me, you belong with me
 
 
D                                               A
Walkin' the streets with you and your worn out jeans
                                              Em
I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be
                                        G
Laughing on a park bench, thinking to myself
Hey isn't this easy
 
 
    D                                                 A
And you've got a smile that could light up this whole town
                                                   Em
I haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down
You say you're fine, I know you better then that
G
Hey whatcha doing with a girl like that
 
 
Em                    G
She wears high heels, I wear sneakers
D                      A
Shes cheer captain and I'm on the bleachers
Em                     G
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
                A
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time
 
 
             D
If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
A                                     Em
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
                G
You belong with me
D
Standing by and waiting at your back door
A                                        Em
All this time how could you not know, baby
                G
You belong with me, you belong with me
 
 
D A Em G
 
                  Em
Oh I remember you drivin' to my house
       G
In the middle of the night
        D
I'm the one who makes you laugh
         A
When you know you're about to cry
      Em
And I know your favorite songs
        G
And you tell me about your dreams
        D
Think I know where you belong
        A
Think I know it's with me
 
 
          D
Can't you see that I'm the one who understands you
A                                     Em
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
                G
You belong with me
D
Standing by and waiting at your back door
A                                        Em
All this time how could you not know, baby
                G                   D
You belong with me, you belong with me
                A
You belong with me
                              Em
Have you ever thought just maybe
                G                   D
You belong with me, you belong with me

I see your face in my mind as I drive away

'Cause none of us thought it was gonna end that way

People are people and sometimes we change our minds

I couldn't always tell if it was Em and C or
Em7 and Cadd9 but it really doesn't make a difference,
just play whatever sounds best and is easiest for you!
 
 
Cadd9           G
 I took a chance, I took a shot
Dsus4                    Em7
 And you might think I'm bulletproof, but I'm not
Cadd9            G
 You took a swing, I took it hard
Dsus4                   Em7
 And down here from the ground I see who you are
 
 
Cadd9                       G
 I'm sick and tired of your attitude
                          D
 I'm feeling like I don't know you
                      Em7
 You tell me that you love me then cut me down
Cadd9                  G
 And I need you like a heartbeat
                        D
 But you know you got a mean streak
                  Em7   D/F#     G Em7 Cadd9
 Makes me run for cover when you're around
Cadd9          D
 And here's to you and your temper
        G                 D/F#      Em7
 Yes, I remember what you said last night
           Cadd9                      D
 And I know that you see what you're doing to me
         G
 Tell me why
 
 
Cadd9              G
 You could write a book on
             D                Em7
 How to ruin someones perfect day
Cadd9             G
 Well I get so confused and frustrated
    D                      Em7
 Forget what I'm trying to say, oh
 
 
Cadd9                       G
 I'm sick and tired of your reasons
                   D
 I got no one to believe in
                      Em7                     Cadd9
 You tell me that you want me, then push me around
                       G
 And I need you like a heartbeat
                        D
 But you know you got a mean streak
                  Em7   D/F#     G Em7 Cadd9
 Makes me run for cover when you're around

 Yes, I remember what you said last night
           Cadd9                      D
 And I know that you see what you're doing to me
         G
 Tell me why
 
 
  Em                  C
Why... do you have to make me feel small
   G                     D
So you can feel whole inside
Em                    C
Why... do you have to put down my dreams
   A                         C  D
So you're the only thing on my mind
 
 
Cadd9                       G
 I'm sick and tired of your attitude
                          D
 I'm feeling like I don't know you
                      Em7              Cadd9
 You tell me that you want me then cut down
                            G
 I'm sick and tired of your reasons
                   D
 I got no one to believe in
                   Em7  D/F#     G      Em7 Cadd9
 You ask me for my love then you push me around
Cadd9      D
 Here's to you and your temper

 Tell me why, why, tell me why,  ohh
 
 
Cadd9              G
 I take a step back, let you go
D                   Em                   G
 I told you I'm not bulletproof, now you know

Song:You're Not Sorry
Tuning: Capo on 4th
 
Chords:
 
  Bm   G   D   A      Em7 Cadd9 G   D
e|-2---3---2---0-|   e|-3---3---3---3-|
B|-3---3---3---2-|   B|-3---3---3---3-| down
G|-4---0---2---2-|   G|-0---0---0---2-| 1/2
D|-4---0---0---2-|   D|-2---2---0---0-| step
A|-2---2---x---0-|   A|-2---3---2---0-|
E|-2---3---x---0-|   E|-0---x---3---0-|
 
Yes, I realize it's the same chords for the whole song.
But I wasn't going to be lazy so I did write out whole thing.
 
Edit: So I just found a video of Taylor playing this acoustic,
and she plays it downtuned 1/2 step and plays the other chords
I added above. I'd recommend the way I originally tabbed it
for anyone who doesn't want to retune their guitar.
 
Bm G D A x2
 
Bm                  G
All this time I was wasting,
                 D          A
Hoping you would come around
          Bm                       G
I've been giving out chances every time
                  D          A
And all you do is let me down
         Bm
And it's taking me this long
G                   D     A
Baby but I figured you out
           Bm
And you're thinking we'll be fine again,
    G         D
But not this time around
 
 
A                 Bm      G
You don't have to call anymore
        D             A
I won't pick up the phone
            Bm   G
This is the last straw
            D        A
Don't wanna hurt anymore
            Bm
And you can tell me that you're sorry
      G
But I don't believe you baby
       D        A
Like I did - before
           Bm   G    D    A
You're not sorry, no noo no noo
 
Bm G D A
 
Bm
Looking so innocent,
  G                        D        A
I might believe you if I didn't know
         Bm
Could've loved you all my life
       G                      D          A
If you hadn't left me waiting in the cold
        Bm
And you got your share of secrets
        G                 D        A
And I'm tired of being last to know
               Bm
And now you're asking me to listen
           G            D
Cause it's worked each time before
 
 
    A                 Bm      G
But you don't have to call anymore
        D             A
I won't pick up the phone
            Bm   G
This is the last straw
            D        A
Don't wanna hurt anymore
            Bm
And you can tell me that you're sorry
      G
But I don't believe you baby
       D        A
Like I did - before
           Bm       G  D  A
You're not sorry no no ohhh
           Bm       G  D  A
You're not sorry no no ohhh
 
Bm G D A x2
 
           Bm
You had me falling for you honey
       G                     D    A
And it never would've gone away, no
            Bm
You used to shine so bright
      G                 D
But I watched all of it fade
 
 
   A                 Bm      G
So you don't have to call anymore
        D             A
I won't pick up the phone
            Bm   G
This is the last straw
                D            A
There's nothing left to beg for
            Bm
And you can tell me that you're sorry
      G
But I don't believe you baby
       D        A
Like I did - before
           Bm       G  D  A
You're not sorry no no ohhh
           Bm       G  D  A
You're not sorry no no ohhh

D                  A
He is sensible and so incredible
    Em                        G
And all my single friends are jealous
D                    A
He says everything I need to hear and it's like
Em                         G
I couldn't ask for anything better
D                       A
He opens up my door and I get into his car
   Em                             G(m)
And he says you look beautiful tonight
           Gm
And I feel perfectly fine
 
 
           D
But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
         A
And it's 2am and I'm cursing your name
       Em
You're so in love that you act insane
    G                A
And that's the way I loved you
D
Breakin' down and coming undone
      A
It's a roller coaster kinda rush
     Em
And I never knew I could feel that much
    G                  Gm   D A Em G A
And that's the way I loved you
 
 
D
He respects my space
    A
And never makes me wait
    Em                       G
And he calls exactly when he says he will
D
He's close to my mother
A
Talks business with my father
     Em
He's charming and endearing
        Gm
And I'm comfortable
 
 
           D
But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain

You're so in love that you act insane

And that's the way I loved you

And I never knew I could feel that much

And that's the way I loved you
 
 
Em                         G
He can't see the smile I'm faking
                   D
And my heart's not breaking
                       A
'Cause I'm not feeling anything at all
    Em
And you were wild and crazy
G                    D
Just so frustrating, intoxicating, complicated
A                            G
Got away by some mistake and now
 
 
           D
But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
         A
And it's 2am and I'm cursing your name
    Em
I'm so in love that I acted insane

And that's the way I loved you

Breakin' down and coming undone

And that's the way I loved you, oh
    G                A      D A
And that's the way I loved you, oh

G Em C D x2
 
G               Em7
 I’m five years old
               C
 It’s getting cold
             D
 I’ve got my big coat on
 
G            Em7
 I hear your laugh
             C
 And look up smiling at you
   D
 I run and run
 
G                 Em7
 Past the pumpkin patch
                 C
 And the tractor rides up now
     D
 The sky is gold
G           Em7             C
 I hug your legs and fall asleep
    D
 On the way home
 
 
C        D                G            D/F#   Em
 I don’t know why all the trees change in the fall
C       D                    G  D/F#     Em
 I know you’re not scared of anything at all
C              D                     G       D/F#  Em
 Don’t know if Snow White’s house is near or far away
                      C             D        G Em7 C D
 But I know I had the best day with you today
 
 
G             Em7
 I’m thirteen now
                C
 And don’t know how my friends
       D
 Could be so mean
 
G            Em7
 I come home crying
         C
 And you hold me tight
     D
 And grab the keys
 
G                   Em7
 And we drive and drive
              C
 Until we’ve found a town
      D
 Far enough away
 
G                Em7
 And we talk and window-shop
       C              D
 Until I’ve forgotten all their names
 
C        D                  G       D/F#   Em
 I don’t know who I’m gonna talk to now at school
C           D               G        D/F#      Em
 I know I’m laughing on the car ride home with you
C               D               G       D/F#  Em
 Don’t know how long it’s gonna take to feel okay
                      C             D        G
 But I know I had the best day with you today
 
 
C
 I have an excellent father
Em
 His strength is making me stronger
C
 God smiles on my little brother
Em                   D
 Inside and out he’s better than I am
 
C                      G
 I grew up in a pretty house
           D/F#
 And I had space to run
     C         D
 And I had the best days with you
 
 
G           Em7
 There is a video
   C                    D
 I found from back when I was three
G             Em7               C
 You set up a paint set in the kitchen
            D
 And you’re talking to me
 
G                 Em7            C
 It’s the edge of princesses and pirate ships
         D
 And the seven dwarves
G                  Em7                  C
 Daddy’s smart and you're the prettiest lady
        D
 In the whole wide world
 
 
C      D                G            D/F#   Em
 Now I know why all the trees change in the fall
C                D          G         D/F#  Em
 I know you were on my side even when I was wrong
       C                   D
 And I love you for giving me your eyes
G        D/F#     Em
 Staying back and watching me shine
    C                 D
 And I didn’t know if you knew
        G           D/F#      Em
 So I’m taking this chance to say
                C             D        G
 That I had the best day with you today

E
 It's just a sad picture,
B/Eb
 The final blow hits you
C#m                          A
 Somebody else gets what you wanted again
E
 You know it's all the same
B/Eb
 Another time and place
C#m                     A
 Repeating history, and your getting sick of it
 
    C#m          A            B
But I believe in whatever you do
            A                     B
And I'll do anything to see it through
 
                            E
Because these things will change
                 B/Eb
Can you feel it now?
                      C#m                          A
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
              E                   B/Eb                  C#m A
It's a revolution, the time will come for us to finally win
                E  B/Eb
We'll sing hallelujah
                C#m A   E
We'll sing hallelujah, oh
 
E
 So we've been outnumbered
B/Eb
 Raided and now cornered
C#m                          A
 It's hard to fight when the fight ain't fair
E
 We're getting stronger now
B/Eb
 From things they never found
C#m                               A         B
 They might be bigger, but we're faster and never scared
C#m            A                    B
 You can walk away and say we don't need this
             A                                   B
 But there's something in your eyes, says we can beat this
 
                          E
Cause these things will change
                 B/Eb
Can you feel it now?
                      C#m                          A
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down

It's a revolution, the time will come for us to finally win
                E  B/Eb
We'll sing hallelujah
                C#m A
We'll sing hallelujah
 C#m A E B x2
Oh
 
E              A               C#m
 Tonight we're standing on our knees
                      A                     E
 To fight for what we worked for all these years
                A                           C#m
 The battle was long, it's the fight of our lives
                  A
 Will we stand up champions tonight?
 
                          E
It was the night things changed
                E/Bb
Can you see it now?
                      C#m                    A
These walls that they put up to hold us back fell down
             E                      E/Bb                C#m   A
It's a revolution, throw your hands up, cause we never gave in
                E  B/Eb
We'll sing hallelujah
                C#m A
We'll sing hallelujah

Hallelujah

G                      C                Em     D
 When I was six years old I broke my leg
G               C                   Em         D
 I was running from my brother and his friends
G                 C                    Em                  D
 And tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass as I rolled down
G                C
 I was younger then,
Em                 D
Take me back to when...
 
[Pre-chorus]
  C            D                G
 I found my heart and broke it here
                    C                      C
 Made friends and lost them through the years
               D                 G
 And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long,
 C
 I know I've grown

 And I can't wait to go home
 
[Chorus]
 G           C
 I'm on my way
Em          D         G            C
 Driving at 90 down those country lanes
 Em          D
 Singing to 'Tiny Dancer'
     G          C           Em       D
 And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
G                C     Em       D
 We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill

[Verse]
G              C               Em                   D
 Fifteen years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes
G                  C                           Em                    D
 Running from the law through the backfields and getting drunk with my friends
G                C                Em
 Had my first kiss on a Friday night,
           D                    G
 I don't reckon that I did it right
                     C
 But I was younger then,

 Take me back to when...
 
[Pre-chorus]
        C         D                 G
 We found weekend jobs, when we got paid
                  C                            C
 We'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight

 Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long, oh how we've grown

 But I can't wait to go home
 
[Chorus]
G           C
 I'm on my way,
 Em        D            G            C

 We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill

             Over the castle on the hill

[Bridge]
Em           C
 One friend left to sell clothes,
G           D
 One works down by the coast,
Em            C
 One had two kids but lives alone,
G        D
 One's brother overdosed,
Em       C
 One's already on his second wife
G            D
 One's just barely getting by
    Em              C
 But these people raised me
      G       D
 And I can't wait to go home

  G          C
 I'm on my way,
 Em          D           G              C
 I still remember these old country lanes,
      Em          D
 When we did not know the answers,
     G           C         Em       D
 And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real,

Standard Tuning
 
The fingerpicking in this song is pretty simple. You just hit the
bass string once, then pick the E B G strings, the exact notes are
not important, just do it in the right rhythm.
 
[Intro]
C    D  E
 
Here's approximately how the picking goes:
 
     C                  D
e|---0----0----0-0-0-0--2-2----0---0----0----0-----0---------|
B|---1----1----1-1-1-1--3-3----0-----0----0----0--------0----|
G|---0----0----0-0-0-0--2-2----1-------1----1----1----1---1--|
D|---2----2----2-2-2-2--0-0----2-----------------------------|
A|---3----3----3-3-3-3---------2-----------------------------|
E|-----------------------------0-----------------------------|
 
[Verse 1] [see tab below for picking]
    E
I met her in a club down in old Soho
           A                      D                     E
where you drink champagne and it tastes just like coca cola
         A   Asus4 A
C-O-L-A, cola
 
    E
She walked up to me and she asked me to dance
  A                           D                         E
I asked her her name and in a dark brown voice she said Lola
         A     D             C     C  D   E
L-O-L-A, Lola,   Lo lo lo lo lola
 
TAB FOR [VERSE 1] it's impossible to tab out the picking exactly right -
it seems almost random - but this is as close as I could get

[Verse 2] and the rest of the song is just strummed. The only thing
to remember is that the electric guitar sometimes throws in two
little fills, one on the E chord, and one on the D chord.

[Verse 2]
     E
Well I'm not the worlds most physical guy
             A
but when she squeezed me tight
           D                     E
she nearly broke my spine, oh my Lola
            A   Asus4 A
Lo lo lo lo Lola
      E
Well I'm not dumb but I can't understand
        A                       D
why she walked like a woman and talked like a man
      E
oh my Lola

[Chorus]
        B
Well we drank champagne and danced all night
F#
under electric candlelight
    A
She picked me up and sat me on her knee
and said 'Dear boy, won't you come home with me'
 
[Verse 3]
     E
Well I'm not the world's most passionate guy
           A                         D                  E
but when I looked in her eye, well I almost fell for my Lola
            A     D            C     C  D
Lo lo lo lo Lola   Lo lo lo lo Lola

  A      C#m  B
I pushed her away

I walked to the door

I fell to the floor

Then I looked at her and she at me
 
[VERSE 4] [the fingerpicking is pretty much the same as in Verse 1]
    E
Well that's the way that I want it to stay
      A                 D                  E
and I always want it to be that way for my Lola

      A                     D                         E
It's a mixed up, muddled up, shook up world except for Lola
            A
Lo lo lo lo Lola
 
[Chorus]
        B
Well I left home just a week before
    F#
And I'd never ever kissed a woman before
A
Lola smiled and took me by the hand
and said 'dear boy, I'm gonna make you a man'
 
[Verse 5]
        E
Well I'm not the worlds most passionate man
     A                      D
but I know what I am and I'm glad I'm a man
          E                 A      D              C     C D

I never came to the beach, or stood by the ocean
Bm                 C               Bm                      C
I never sat by the shore, under the sun with my feet in the sand

But you brought me here and I'm happy that you did

Hello,
                 A
is there anybody in there? 
     G              Em
Just nod if you can hear me;
         Bm
is there anyone home? 
 
 
Come on, now,
              A
I hear you're feeling down.
      G               Em
Well, I can ease your pain;
        Bm
get you on your feet again.
 
Relax,
                 A
I need some information first.
G              Em
Just the basic facts:
        Bm
can you show me where it hurts? 
 
D                           A
There is no pain, you are receding.
D                              A
A distant ships smoke on the horizon.
C                              G
You are only coming through in waves.
     C                                      G
Your lips move but I can't hear what you re saying.
     D                     A
When I was a child I had a fever.
   D                           A
My hands felt just like two balloons.
C                            G
Now I got that feeling once again;
                     C
I can't explain, you would not understand.
                  G
This is not how I am.
A C       G                 D
I  have become, comfortably numb.
 
D  A  D  A  C  G  C  G

Ok, (ok)
              A
just a little pinprick.

There'll be no more --aaaaaahhhhh!
            Bm
But you may feel a little sick.
 
 
Can you stand up?
                  A
I do believe it's working good.
                 G              Em
That'll keep you going for the show.

Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying.
     D                        A
When I was a child I caught a fleeting glimpse,
D                       A
out of the corner of my eye.
  C                         G
I turned to look but it was gone.
                       C
I cannot put my finger on it now.
                        G
The child is grown, the dream is gone.
A C       G                 D
I  have become, comfortably numb.

[Verse 1]
 
G                                     C
If my words did glow with the gold of sunshine
C                                        G
And my tunes were played on the harp unstrung
G                                        C
Would you hear my voice come through the music
C         G       D    C               G
Would you hold it near as it were your own?
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
G                                     C
It's a hand-me-down, the thoughts are broken
C                             G
Perhaps they're better left unsung
G                          C
I don't know, don't really care
G            D     C           G
Let there be songs to fill the air
 
 
[Chorus]
 
Am              D
Ripple in still water
           G            C
When there is no pebble tossed
    A       D
Nor wind to blow 
 
 
[Verse 3]
               G                   C
Reach out your hand if your cup be empty
C                                G
If your cup is full may it be again
G                          C
Let it be known there is a fountain
G            D    C               G
That was not made by the hands of men 
 
 
Verse 4
G                          C
There is a road, no simple highway
C                                G
Between the dawn and the dark of night
G                        C
And if you go no one may follow
G            D   C          G
That path is for your steps alone
 
 
[Chorus]
 
Am              D
Ripple in still water
           G            C
When there is no pebble tossed
    A       D
Nor wind to blow 
 
 
[Verse 5]
 
        G                   C
You who choose to lead must follow
C                          G
But if you fall you fall alone
G                                 C
If you should stand then who's to guide you?
G             D   C                G
If I knew the way I would take you home
 
 
[Outro Verse]
 
           G                C
Lat da dat da, Lah da-ah da da, da
C                                G
La da da, la da, da da da-ah, da da
G                           C
Lat da dat da, Lah da-ah da da, da
G        D   C            G
La da da da, Lah da da da da

C                         G
If you believe it's in my soul
        D
I'd say all the words that I know
C                       G
Just to see if it would show
         D                 C
That I'm trying to let you know
                          G
That I'm better off on my own.

Well, she was an American girl
G         A
Raised on promises
D                 E7
She couldn't help thinkin' that there was a

little more to life somewhere else

She stood alone on the balcony
D                        E7
Yeah, she could hear the cars roll by
       G              A
Out on 441 like waves crashin' on the beach
 
[Pre-Chorus]
A                     D
And for one desperate moment there
G                    Em
He crept back in her memory

God it's so painful when something that's so close is still so far out of reach

I can't even leave my bedroom so I keep pouring

And I ain't seen the light of day since, well, that's not important
            C
It's been long

Show no emotion, against your coding

It seems like every plug ran east to Utah, became Mormons
F
Drought comes around, feels like I have no one to depend on
C
Sober, ugh
 
C
I had 80 beers on Tuesday night, I had nothing to do with it
Am
I put on a little Dwight and sang a happy tune
    F
And lit a cigarette, stepped out the door, had an appearance
C
Drank more

It's easy to say
                    G
But it's never the same
                Am                                F
I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain
 
 
[Chorus]
              C
Now the day bleeds
           G
Into nightfall
                Am
And you're not here
                      F
To get me through it all
                C
I let my guard down
                         G
And then you pulled the rug
                    Am                        F
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
 
 
[Verse 2]
C                          G                              Am    F
  I'm going under and this time I fear there's no one to turn to
C                            G                          Am     F
  This all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you
                         C
Now, I need somebody to know
              G
Somebody to heal
             Am
Somebody to have
                      F
Just to know how it feels
              C                      G
It's easy to say but it's never the same
                Am                            F
I guess I kinda liked the way you helped me escape
 
 
[Chorus]
                  C
Now the day bleeds
              G
Into nightfall
                   Am
And you're not here

[Bridge]
    Dm         Am                   G
And I tend to close my eyes when it hurts sometimes
         Am      Dm
I fall into your arms
         Am                        G
I'll be safe in your sound till I come back around
 
 
[Chorus]
N.C.                   C
For now the day bleeds
              G
Into nightfall
                   Am
And you're not here
                        F

I made this a long time ago and I think these Chords are perfect for beginners. I
actually use these chords in intro, verse and chorus (pre-chorus is still the same):

[Verse]
 
Em     G        C                Am
   Sometimes, I feel the fear of
     Em        G              C  Am
   uncertainty stinging clear.
Em     G       C              Am
   And I can't help but ask myself
                 Em           G                  C     Am
   how much I'll let the fear take the wheel and steer
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
 
C                   A                            C
   It's driven me before, and it seems to have a vague,
   A
   haunting mass appeal
C             A                          C
   But lately I'm beginning to find that I
                 A
   should be the one behind the wheel.

Em      G        C          Am               Em             G  C  Am

[Pre-Chorus]
 
C                   A                           C

             A
   that everyone else gets around
C             A                          C

At hindi naman ako yung tipong nagseseryoso

Lolokohin lang kita kaya kung pwede wag nalang

Wag kang maniniwala

Kahit mahirap

Kakayanin ko 
 
E-B
Dahil para sayo

Handa akong magpakatino 
A      E
Laging isipin

Lahat ay gagawin 
E-C#m-G#m-A
Basta para sayo

Bakit nakikinig kapa 
              C#m
Matatapos na ang kanta 
               A
Pinapatakas na kita Mula nung una stanza 
               E
Hindi kaba natatakot
C#m            G#m
Baka ikaw ay masangkot 
A
Sa mga kasalanan ko 
 
 
[Chorus]

Ako'y magbabago

I wanna watch the way you take the stage by storm

                                      G              D
There probably was a problem with the post office or somethin'
Em                                 C                     D
Sometimes I scribble addresses too sloppy when I jot 'em
                        G                  D        Em
But anyway, what's been up man, how's your daughter?
                                            C
My girlfriend's pregnant too, I'm bout to be a father
            A/C#                               C
If I have a daughter, guess what I'm a call her
                      Em
I'm a name her Bonnie
                        C
I read about your Uncle Ronnie too, I'm sorry
 D                                G                    D        Em
I had a friend kill himself over some b**** who didn't want him
                                       C                         D
I know you probably hear this every day, but I'm your biggest fan
                       G                           D     Em
I even got that underground s*** that you did with Skam
                          C                             D
I got a room full of your posters and your pictures man
                              G                D             Em
I like that s*** you did with Rawkus too, that s*** was phat
                    C
Anyways, I hope you get this man, hit me back
A/C#                            C
Just to chat, truly yours, your biggest fan, this is Stan
 
[Chorus]
Em            C                   D
My tea's gone cold, I'm wonderin' why
    G      D         Em
Got out of bed at all
            C                 D
The morning rain clouds up my window
    G       D         Em
And I can't see at all
         C                D
And even if I could it'll all be gray
         G       D         Em
But your picture on my wall
        C               A/C#
It reminds me that it's not so bad
     C         Em
It's not so bad
 
[Verse 2]
     Em                               C
Dear Slim, you still ain't called or wrote, I hope you have a chance,
D                              G                                   Em
I ain't mad, I think it's just f***** up that you don't answer fans
                            C
If you didn't wanna talk to me outside your concert
           D                                   G             D
You didn't have to, but you could've signed an autograph for Matthew
         Em                             C
That's my little brother man, he's only six years old
                 D
We waited in the blistering cold for you
    G                  D            Em
For four hours and you just said no
                                 C
That's pretty s****y man, you're like his f***ing idol
   A/C#                               C                       Em
He wants to be just like you man, he likes you more than I do
                        C
I ain't that mad though, I just don't like being lied to
      D                       G               D
Remember when we met in Denver, you said if I write you
          Em                           C
You would write back, see I'm just like you in a way
                D
I never knew my father neither
           G                  D                Em
He used to always cheat on my mom and beat her
                            C
I can relate to what you're saying in your songs
          D                          G               D
So when I have a s****y day, I drift away and put em on
              Em                                 C
Cause I don't really got s*** else, so that s*** helps when I'm depressed
A/C#                        C
I even got a tattoo of your name across the chest
Em                             C
Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds
         D                            G             D
Its like adrenaline, the pain is such a sudden rush for me
        Em                              C
See everthing you say is real, and I respect you cause you tell it
       D                               G              D
My girlfriend's jealous, because I talk about you 24/7
Em                                     C
But she don't know you like I know you slim, no one does
D                                         G                 D
She don't know what it was like for people like us growin' up
          Em                               C
You gotta call me man, I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose
          A/C#
Sincerely yours, Stan, p.s.
C
We should be together too

Got out of bed at all

[Verse 3]
Em                       C                    D
Dear Mr I'm-Too-Good-To-Call-Or-Write-My-Fans
                              G                 D
This'll be the last package I ever send your a**
              Em
It's been six months and still no words
           C
I don't deserve it
                  D
I know you got my last two letters
               G                     D
I wrote the addresses on them perfect
Em                                    C
So this is my cassette I'm sending you, I hope you hear it
    D                               G               D
I'm in the car right now, I'm doin' 90 on the freeway
Em                           C                      A/C#
Hey Slim, I drank a fifth of vodka, dare me to drive?
                           C
You know that song by Phil Collins, In the Air of the Night
Em                                     C
About that guy who could've saved that other guy from drowning
    D                           G                         D
But didn't, but Phil saw it all, then at a show he found him
Em                                     C
That's kinda how this is, you could've rescued me from drowning
         D                        G            D
Now it's too late, I'm on a 1,000 downers now, I'm drowsy
Em                          C
And all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call
D                                    G           D
I hope you know I ripped all of your pictures off my wall
Em                           C                          A/C#
I love you Slim, we could've been together, think about it
                    C                                           Em
You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it
                               C
And when you dream, I hope you can't sleep and you scream about it
D                             G                  D                Em
I hope your conscience eats at you and you can't breathe without me
             C
See Slim, shut up b****, I'm trying to talk
D                       G                       D
Hey Slim, that's my girlfriend screamin' in the trunk
Em                                            C
But I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her up, see I ain't like you
D                                      G                 D      Em
Cause if she suffocates, she'll suffer more, then she'll die too
               C                               A/C#
Well, gotta go, I'm almost under the bridge now
                  C
Oh s***, I forgot, how am I supposed to send this s*** out?

[Verse 4]
Em                                    C
Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner, but I've just been busy
D                                     G                  D
You say your girlfriend's pregnant now, how far along is she?
Em                                   C
Look, I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that
              D
And here's an autograph for your brother
  G           D               Em
I wrote it on this Starter cap
                   C
I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I must've missed you
D                           G             D               Em
Don't think I did that s*** intentionally just to dis you
                             C                                      A/C#
But what's that s*** you said about you like to cut your wrists too?
                                  C
I say that s*** just clownin' dog
                             Em
C'mon, how f***ed up is you?
                             C
You got some issues, Stan, I think you need some counseling 
D                                      G                  D         Em
To keep your a** from bouncin' off the walls when you get down some
                              C
And what's this s*** about us meant to be together?
D                                  G                    D     Em
That type of s*** will make me not want us to meet each other
                            C
I really think you and your girlfriend need each other
D                                   G
Or maybe you just need to treat her better
D                 Em                          C
I hope you get to read this letter, I hope it reaches you in time                
           A/C#                               C
Before you hurt yourself, I think that you'll be doin just fine
         Em                              C
If you relax a little, I'm glad that I inspire you, but Stan
    D                           G                D             Em
Why are you so mad? Try to understand, that I do want you as a fan
                         C
I just don't want you to do some crazy s***
            D                                G              D            Em
I seen this one s*** on the news a couple of weeks ago that made me sick
                                  C
Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge
            D                                   G                 D
And had his girlfriend in his trunk and she was pregnant with his kid
           Em                            C
And in the car they found a tape, didn't say who it was to
        A/C#                         C              Em
Come to think about it, his name was, it was you...

Like a hurt lost and blinded fool, fool.
Em                            Dm                G
   Oh no, I've said too much.    I said enough.

Consider this,    consider this hint of the century.

Consider this,    the slip, that brought me to my knees pale.

What if all these fantasies come    flaming aground.

The tab is for the mandolin part not the acousitic guitar
part(but the chords are at the top of this page)  The chords
above the tab refer to the acoustic guitar and not to the mandolin
parts, the reason I put them is for a reference to when you play what.
Also I am too lazy to write all the parts eveytime they appear because
there's a lot of repeating.  Okay now that the explanation is done,

Fill 1   Am             Em
 Oh life    is bigger,    it's bigger than you.
            Am                              Em
And you are not me, the lengths that I will go to.
                           Am
The distance in your eyes.
Em                  Em(II) Ebm Dm                      G
   Oh no, I've said     too    much, I've said enough.
                         Am                  Em
That's me in the corner,    That's me in the spot light,
                    Am           Em
Losing my religion.    Trying to keep up with you.
      Am
And I don't know if I can do it.
Em                  Em(II) Ebm Dm                           G
   Oh no, I've said     too    much, I haven't said enough.
   Fill2                                        F    Fsus2
I thought that I heard you laughing.
F                G         Am    Am(II)
I thought that I heard you sing.
  F          Fsus2  F   G   Am
I think I thought I saw you try.
G  (fill3)     Am
  Every whisper,
             Em                                 Am
Every waking hour, I'm choosing my confessions.
          Em
Trying to keep eye on you.
       Am
Like a hurt lost and blinded fool, fool.
Em                            Dm                G
   Oh no, I've said too much.    I said enough.
               Am               Em
Consider this,    consider this hint of the century.
               Am                Em
Consider this,    the slip, that brought me to my knees failed
Am                               Em
What if all these fantasies come    flailing around
               Dm             G
Now I've said too much.
   fill2                                  F Fsus2
I thought that I heard you laughing.
F                G         Am    Am(II)
I thought that I heard you sing.
  F          Fsus2  F   G   Am   G
I think I thought I saw you try.

Standard Tuning (EADGBE), Capo 1
 
This tab covers all bars as played in the album version,
if a chord is played over more than one bar then it's either duplicated or marked with a ""(2x)"".
The indentation should also be fine so that the chords match the words.
 
This is the version I play on my acoustic guitar, I hope you like it.

Words & Music by Don Felder & Glenn Frey
 
 
[Intro]
 
Bm  F#7  A  E7  G  D  Em  F#7  x2
 
 
[Verse]
 
Bm                        F#7
On a dark desert highway, cool wind in my hair
A                     E7
Warm smell of colitas rising up through the air
G                         D
Up ahead in the distance, I saw a shimmering light
Em                                        F#7
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim; I had to stop for the night.
 
Bm                              F#7
There she stood in the doorway; I heard the mission bell
A                                            E7
And I was thinking to myself, ""This could be Heaven or this could be Hell""
G                        D
Then she lit up a candle and she showed me the way
Em                                  F#7
There were voices down the corridor I thought I heard them say...
 
 
[Chorus]
 
G                        D
Welcome to the Hotel California...
       F#7                                        Bm
Such a lovely place, (such a lovely place) such a lovely face...
G                               D
Plenty of room at the Hotel California...
    Em                                       F#7
Any time of year, (any time of year) you can find it here...
 
 
[Verse]
 
Bm                           F#7
Her mind is Tiffany-twisted, she got the Mercedes Bends
A                                     E7
She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys, that she calls friends
G                                D
How they dance in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat
Em                      F#7
Some dance to remember, some dance to forget
 
Bm                           F#7
So I called up the Captain, ""Please bring me my wine""
          A                                     E7
He said, ""We haven't had that spirit here since nineteen sixty nine""
G                                       D
And still those voices are calling from far away,
Em                                     F#7
Wake you up in the middle of the night just to hear them say...
 
 
[Chorus]
 
G                        D
Welcome to the Hotel California...
       F#7                                        Bm        F#7
Such a lovely place, (such a lovely place) such a lovely face...
G                                  D
They livin' it up at the Hotel California...
       Em                                               F#7
What a nice surprise, (what a nice surprise) bring your alibis...
 
 
[Verse]
 
Bm                      F#7
Mirrors on the ceiling, the pink champagne on ice
              A                               E7
And she said ""We are all just prisoners here, of our own device""
G                            D
And in the master's chambers, they gathered for the feast
Em                                              F#7
They stab it with their steely knives, but they just can't kill the beast
 
Bm                           F#7
Last thing I remember, I was running for the door
A                                 E7
I had to find the passage back to place I was before
G                                   D
""Relax"" said the night man, ""We are programmed to receive.
Em                                   F#7
You can check out any time you like, but you can never leave"".

Come on skinny love just last the year
Am            C                  C/G
Pour a little salt we were never here
        Am            C            C/G
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my
            G/B                           Am     C      C/G
Staring at the sink of blood and crushed veneer
 
  Am        C              C/G
I tell my love to wreck it all
   Am               C              C/G
Cut out all the ropes and let me fall
       Am             C             C/G
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my

I told you to be fine
      C
I told you to be balanced
 G/B              F/A
I told you to be kind
           C
In the morning I'll be with you
           G/B              F/A
But it will be a different ""kind""
          C
I'll be holding all the tickets
             G/B           F/A
And you'll be owning all the fines
 
 
[Verse]
 
  Am            C              C/G
Come on skinny love what happened here
Am              C            C/G
Suckle on the hope in lite brassiere
      Am             C          C/G
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my
         G/B                           Am      C      C/G
Sullen load is full; so slow on the split
 
 
[Chorus]
 
     C
I told you to be patient
  G/B        F/A
I told you to be fine
      C
I told you to be balanced
 G/B            F/A
I told you to be kind
          C
Now all your love is wasted?
   G/B               F/A
Then who the hell was I?
             C
Now I'm breaking at the britches
        G/B             F/A
And at the end of all your lines
 
C                                   G/B
 Who will love you?
F/A
 Who will fight?
C            G/B       F/A
 Who will fall far behind?

C             G
Don't make me sad, don't make me cry
          D            Em
Sometimes love is not enough when the road gets tough
 
I don't know why
C               G
Keep making me laugh,
 
Let's go get high
D
The road is long, we carry on
Em
Try to have fun in the meantime
 
 
[Chorus]
 
C                             G
Come and take a walk on the wild side
                                    D
Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain
                   Em
You like your girls insane
C                  G
Choose your last words,
D
This is the last time
 
Cause you and I
        Em
We were born to die
 
C               G
We were born to die
D               Em
We were born to die

[Verse 1]
G
We broke up a month ago
     Em
Your friends are mine
                             Am
You know I know you've moved on
 
Found someone new,
          D
One more girl who brings out the better in you
    G
And I thought my heart was detached
     Em
From all the sunlight of our past
     Am
But she's so sweet,
 
She's so pretty,
 D
Does she mean you forgot about me?
 
 
[Chorus]
  G
I hope you’re happy
    Em
But not like how you were with me
    Am
I’m selfish I know, I can’t let you go
   D7
So find someone great, but don’t find no one better
                    N.C.
I hope you’re happy but don’t be happier
 
 
[Verse 2]
G                                                             Em
And do you tell her she's the most beautiful girl you've ever seen?
                                               Am
An eternal love bullshit you know you'll never mean
 
Remember when I believed
                       D
You meant it when you said it first to me?
    G
And now I'm pickin' her apart,
     Em
Like cuttin' her down will make you miss my wretched heart
          Am
But she’s beautiful, she looks kind
    D7
She probably gives you butterflies
 
 
[Chorus]
  G
I hope you’re happy
    Em
But not like how you were with me
    Am
I’m selfish I know, I can’t let you go
   D7
So find someone great, but don’t find no one better
 
 
[Bridge]
G
I hope you're happy
   Em
I wish you all the best, really
    Am
Say you love her, baby
 
Just not like you love me
     D            D7
And think of me fondly when your hand's are on her
                    N.C
I hope you're happy but don't be happier
 
 
[Interlude]
G           Em          Am           D
Ooooh oh oh ooooh oh oh ooooh oh oh ooooh oooh oooh oooh
 
 
[Outro]
   G
I hope you're happy
     Em
Just not like how you were with me
     Am
I'm selfish, I know
 
I can't let you go
    D
So find someone great but don't find no one better
   D7
I hope you're happy
    N.C.
But don't be happier

[Verse 1]
 
          G               D              C           Am7
It's not time to make a change, just re-lax, take it easy,
               G                 Em                Am                D
You're still young, that's your fault, there's so much you have to know,
        G             D           C             Am7
Find a girl, settle down, if you want, you can marry,
        G         Em           Am7   D
Look at me, I am old, but I'm happy
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
        G               Bm7          C                 Am7         G
I was once like you are now, and I know that it's not easy to be calm,
              Em                  Am7  D                G            Bm7
When you've found something going on,    but take your time, think a lot,
                  C             Am7                 G                Em
Why, think of everything you've got, for you will still be here to-morrow,
            D        G  C/G     G   C/G
But your dreams may not
 
 
[Verse 3]
 
        G             Bm7            C               Am7
How can I try to ex-plain?    When I do , he turns a-way again!
       G                  Em               Am7  D
It's always been the same,   the same old story,
            G            Bm7           C         Am7
From the moment I could talk, I was ordered to listen,
               G          Em           D     G
Now there's a way, and I know that I have to go away,

I know I have to go

It's hard,      but it's harder    to ig-nore it!

[Verse 1]
E
This town is colder now, I think it's sick of us

It's time to make our move, I'm shakin off the rust
E
I've got my heart set on anywhere but here
B/Eb                                     C#m
I'm staring down myself, counting up the years

C#m                         A
Steady hands, just take the wheel
                            C#m
And every glance is killing me
                        A
Time to make one last appeal
 
For the life I lead
 
[Chorus]
E
Stop and stare
                         B
I think I'm moving but I go nowhere
                      C#m
Yeah I know that everyone gets scared
                            A
But I've become what I can't be, oh
E
Stop and stare

You start to wonder why you're 'here' not there
                             C#m
And you'd give anything to get what's fair
                              A
But fair ain't what you really need

They're tryin to come back, all my senses push
                                          C#m
Un-tie the weight bags, I never thought I could
                           A
Steady feet, don't fail me now
                         C#m
Gonna run till you can't walk
                             A
But something pulls my focus out
                        E
And I'm standing down

Yeah I know that everyone gets scared

But I've become what I can't be, oh

Stop and stare

Everywhere you go;

Dolls that will talk and will go for a walk

It's the sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow.

     Am
Hey, once upon a younger year
 
When all our shadows disappeared

The animals inside came out to play

Hey, when face to face with all our fears

[Verse]
C
Regrets collect like old friends
Am
Here to relive your darkest moments
F
I can see no way, I can see no way
C
And all of the ghouls come out to play
 
Am          F                     C
And every demon wants his pound of flesh
              G                     Am
But I like to keep some things to myself
           F             Dm
I like to keep my issues drawn
             F
It's always darkest before the dawn
 
C
And I've been a fool and I've been blind
Am                          F
I can never leave the past behind
 
I can see no way, I can see no way
C
I'm always dragging that horse around
 
Am               F                      C
All of his questions, such a mournful sound
                   G                       Am
Tonight I'm gonna bury that horse in the ground
              F              Dm
So I like to keep my issues strong
                 F
But it's always darkest before the dawn
 
[Chorus]
C
Shake it out, shake it out, shake it out, shake it out, ooh woaaah
Am
Shake it out, shake it out, shake it out, shake it out, ooh woaaaah
F
And it's hard to dance with a devil on your back
              C
So shake him off, oh woah
 
[Verse]
Am    F                      C
I am done with my graceless heart
                      G                      Am
So tonight I'm gonna cut it out and then restart
                 F              Dm
Cause I like to keep my issues drawn
             F
It's always darkest before the dawn
 
[Chorus]
C
Shake it out, shake it out, shake it out, shake it out, ooh woaaah
Am
Shake it out, shake it out, shake it out, shake it out, ooh woaaah
F
And it's hard to dance with a devil on your back
              C
So shake him off, oh woah
 
[Verse]
Am                             F
And it's hard to dance with a devil on your back
C                                  G
And given half the chance would I take any of it back
Am                          F
It's a fine romance but it's left me so undone
Dm            F                C
It's always darkest before the dawn
C
Oh woah, oh woah...
 
[Bridge]
Dm
And I'm damned if I do and I'm damned if I don't
Am                                     G
So here's to drinks in the dark at the end of my rope
Dm
And I'm ready to suffer and I'm ready to hope
Am                           G
It's a shot in the dark aimed right at my throat
F
Cause looking for heaven, found the devil in me
Am                            G
Looking for heaven, found the devil in me
F
Well what the hell I'm gonna let it happen to me
 
[Chorus]
C
Shake it out, shake it out, shake it out, shake it out, ooh woaaah
Am
Shake it out, shake it out, shake it out, shake it out, ooh woaaah
F
And it's hard to dance with a devil on your back
C
So shake him off, oh woah
C
Shake it out, shake it out, shake it out, shake it out, ooh woaaah
Am
Shake it out, shake it out, shake it out, shake it out, ooh woaaah
F
And it's hard to dance with a devil on your back
C
So shake him off, oh woah

What a friend we have in Jesus,
G                          D
All our sins and griefs to bear!
 G                   C

 G    D               G
Everything to God in prayer

Oh, what needless pain we bear

all because we do not carry
G    D                  G
everything to God in prayer.
 
[Verse 2]
 G                      C
Have we trials and temptations?
G                   D
Is there trouble anywhere?
G                      C
We should never be discouraged,
G       D               G
Take it to the Lord in prayer.
Am                       G
Can we find a friend so faithful?
C         G                D
Who will all our sorrows share?
 G                       C
Jesus knows our every weakness,
 G      D                 G
Take it to the Lord in prayer.
 
[Verse 3]
 G                     C
Are we weak and heavy laden,
  G                      D
Cumbered with a load of care?
 G                          C
Precious Savior, still our refuge
G       D               G
Take it to the Lord in prayer.
Am                         G
Do thy friends despise forsake thee?
 C       G              D
Take it to the Lord in prayer.

Blessed Savior, Thou hast promised
G                         D
Thou wilt all our burdens bear;
G                      C
May we ever, Lord, be bringing
G       D               G
All to Thee in earnest prayer.
Am                       G
Soon in glory bright, unclouded,
C          G               D
There will be no need for prayer—
 G                           C
Rapture, praise, and endless worship
 G      D                 G
Will be our sweet portion there.

It's late in the evening, glass on the side, I've been sat with you for most of the night
           C#m
Ignoring everybody here, we wish they would disappear, so maybe we could get down now
   G#m
And I don't wanna know, If you're getting ahead of the program

I want you to be mine, lady

To hold your body close, take another step into the no-man's land

This love is ablaze, I saw flames from the side of the stage, 
 
and the fire brigade comes in a couple of days
    G#m
Until then we've got nothing to say and nothing to know
But something to drink and maybe something to smoke
C#m
Let it go until our roads will change, 
Singing we found love in a local rave
C#m
No I don't really know what I'm supposed to say, 
But I can just figure it out and hope and pray
G#m
I told her my name, I said it's nice to meet you, 
Then she handed me a bottle of water filled with tequila
G#m
I already know she's a keeper, just from this one small act of kindness, I'm in
C#m
Deep shit If anybody finds out I'm meant to drive home, but I took all of it down
Not sobering up we sit on the couch
C#m
One thing led to another now she's kissing my mouth

Can you feel it, all the guys in here don't even want to dance

Can you feel it, all that I can hear is music from the back
         C#m
Can you feel it, I found you hiding here so wont you take my hand

Darling, before the beat kicks in again

[Intro]
Fmaj7   E7  Am7   C7
 
[Verse 1]
                        Fmaj7
Thought I'd end up with Sean
                E7
But he wasn't a match
                       Am7
Wrote some songs about Ricky
                 C7
Now I listen and laugh
                Fmaj7
Even almost got married
                     E7
And for Pete, I'm so thankful
                                 Am7
Wish I could say, ""Thank you"" to Malcolm
                 C7
'Cause he was an angel
 
[Pre-Chorus]
              Fmaj7
One taught me love
              E7
One taught me patience
                  Am7
And one taught me pain
             C7
Now, I'm so amazing
                    Fmaj7
I've loved and I've lost
                    E7
But that's not what I see
                Am7
So, look what I got
              C7
Look what you taught me
                Fmaj7
And for that, I say

                      E7
I ain't worried 'bout nothin'
                    Am7
Plus, I met someone else
                    C7
We havin' better discussions
                       Fmaj7
I know they say I move on too fast
                  E7
But this one gon' last
                   Am7

One day I'll walk down the aisle
                      E7
Holding hands with my mama
                    Am7
I'll be thanking my dad

'Cause she grew from the drama

     G                            C
I've been a wild rover for many a year
  G            C        D7          G
I spent all me money on whiskey and beer
    G                                    C
But now I'm returning with gold in great store
      G          C             D7       G
And I never will play the wild rover no more
 
 
[Chorus]
         D7           G                C
And it's no nay never, no nay never no more
       G             C         D7        G
Will I play the wild rover, no never, no more
 
 
[Verse 2]
  G                                   C
I went in to an alehouse I used to frequent
      G            C       D7        G
And I told the landlady me money was spent
  G                                      C
I asked her for credit, she answered me ""Nay!""
      G         C             D7       G
""Such custom as yours I could have any day!""
 
 
[Chorus]
          D7           G                C
 And it's no nay never, no nay never no more
        G             C         D7        G
 Will I play the wild rover, no never, no more
 
 
[Verse 3]
  G                                    C
I took out of me pocket ten sovereigns bright
        G          C           D7          G
And the landlady's eyes opened wide with delight
    G                                       C
She said: ""I have whiskeys and wines on the best!
        G            C             D7      G
And the words that I told you were only in jest!""
 
 
[Chorus]
         D7           G                C
And it's no nay never, no nay never no more
       G             C         D7        G
Will I play the wild rover, no never, no more
 
 
[Verse 4]
        G                                     C
I'll go home to my parents, confess what I've done
    G           C            D7       G
And ask them to pardon their prodigal son
    G                                     C
And when they've caressed me as oftimes before
  G          C             D7       G
I never will play the wild rover no more.
 
 
[Chorus]
         D7           G                C
And it's no nay never, no nay never no more
       G             C         D7        G
Will I play the wild rover, no never, no more
       D7           G                C
And it's no nay never, no nay never no more
       G             C         D7        G
Will I play the wild rover, no never, no more

I'm walking down the line
That divides me somewhere in my mind
On the border line
Of the edge and where I walk alone
 
Read between the lines
What's fucked up and everything's alright
Check my vital signs
To know I'm still alive and I walk alone
 
I walk alone
I walk alone
 
I walk alone
I walk a...

W/Capo : D/A/Bm/G
w/out capo: E/B/C#m/A
 
This is a brilliant composition by Axis Of Awesome, I thought I'd tab this version,
it has more songs, and its also more challenging than the CD
version.
 
Note: There is a tricky change in chord structure after ""save tonight"".
 
Enjoy!

         Bm       G
Yeah she will, be loved.
            D                A
Pictures of you, pictures of me,
             Bm                    G
up upon your wall for the world to see.
              D    A        Bm          G
'cause I cant live, with or without you.
         D     A       Bm   G
And if I fall, at your feet.
                D               A              Bm
You'll let your tears, am I not pretty enough,

[Back to original chord structure]
 
                   D
Nothings right I'm torn,

doesn't that sound too close to home
                      Bm
doesn't that make you shiver,
                          G
the way things could have gone.
                      D
And doesn't that seem peculiar,
                        A
'cause everyone wants a little more,
                         Bm
there's something I do remember,
                 G
to never go this far,

 ""What we've got here is failure to communicate

Look at your young men fighting

It's not supposed to feel this way

            D                                        D/C

                              G/B            Gm/Bb     A
And come back to me when you notice how you feel, you feel
 
G                  G/F#

Em7                 A
Even though you're far away

I can feel, I can feel you baby why

It's not supposed to feel this way

       D                          Em     C       A
He was born in the summer, of his twenty seventh year;
       D                          Em     G
Coming home to a place he'd never been before
   D
He left yesterday behind him,
          Em         C     A
you might say he was born again
          D                      Em    G
You might say he found a key for every door
 
        D                                Em       C    A
When he first came to the mountains, his life was far away;
       D                Em   G
On the road and hanging by a song
        D                               Em      C      A
But the string's already broken, and he doesn't really care;
         D                           Em       G     A
It keeps changing fast, and it don't last for long
 
        G        A              D
But the Colorado Rocky Mountain high
     G               A           D
I've seen it raining fire in the sky
    G               A            D             G   A  G
The shadow from the starlight is softer than a lul la by 
      A        D   Em    G
Rocky Mountain high, Colorado
      A        D   Em    G     A7
Rocky Mountain high, Colorado
 
   D                                   Em     C        A
He climbed cathedral mountains, he saw silver clouds below;
       D                    Em      G
he saw everything as far as you can see
         D
And they say that he got crazy once,
       Em       C         A
and he tried to touch the sun;
       D                 Em       C   G
And he lost a friend but kept the memory
 
       D                            Em      C       A
Now he walks in quiet solitude, the forests and the streams;
        D              Em      G
seeking grace in every step he takes 
    D                                  Em      C    A
His sight has turned inside himself to try and understand;
      D           Em         C        G
the serenity of a clear blue mountain lake
 
        G        A              D
And the Colorado Rocky Mountain high
     G               A           D
I've seen it raining fire in the sky
G               A             D   G  A  G
talk to God and listen to the casual re ply
      A        D   Em    G
Rocky Mountain high, Colorado
      A        D   Em    G     A7
Rocky Mountain high, Colorado
 
        D
Now his life is full of wonder,
        Em          C          A
but his heart still knows some fear;
     D               Em     C     G
of a simple thing he cannot comprehend
         D
Why they try to tear the mountains down,
   Em         C      A
To bring in a couple more;
     D            Em     C       G
more people, more scars upon the land
 
        G        A              D
And the Colorado Rocky Mountain high
     G               A           D
I've seen it raining fire in the sky
  G              A                D            G   A  G
I know he'd be a poorer man if he never saw an eag le fly
      A        D
Rocky Mountain high
 
        G        A              D
And the Colorado Rocky Mountain high
     G               A           D
I've seen it raining fire in the sky
G                  A            D     A      G
Friends around the campfire and every body's high
      A        D   Em    G
Rocky Mountain high, Colorado
      A        D   Em    G
Rocky Mountain high, Colorado
      A        D   Em    G
Rocky Mountain high, Colorado

These are the lyrics most often used when O.A.R. covers ""Redemption Song"" - this
particular version is from Carroll College - Waukesha, WI, 11/01/03.
 
Chords used:
 
        G      Em7     C       G/B    Am     Em     D     Dsus
e|------3------------------------3-----------------------2--------3--|

G|----------------------------------------2--------------2--------2--|
D|----------------------2-----------------2-------2------------------|
A|------2-------2-------3--------2----------------2------------------|
E|------3------------------------------------------------x-----------|
 
 
Notes: The Dsus after the D in the last line of the verses isn't required. I play
it to give the song a slightly higher pitch right leading into the chorus. When
you play it, make sure you hit the first string U/U/D/U and then change back to a
D after that U/U/D/U strumming sequence. Give it a try, I think it sounds better
that way. Also, on the 4th line of second and third verses, Marc mutes the C
chord right after switching to it and finishes the line ""a cappella."" Then start
up with G again normally on the next line. Same thing with the last line on the
third verse - mute the G and then it's a cappella until the G in the beginning of the chorus.

Old pirates, yes, they rob I

sold I to the merchant ships
 G                     Em      C
Minutes after they took I

from the bottomless pit.
        G             Em7       C

by the hand of the Almighty.

[Verse 2]
 
      G                             Em7
Emancipate yourselves from mental slavery

[Verse 1]
    G            C          G
I'm singing at a funeral tomorrow
      Em         C             D
For a kid a year older than me
               G
And I've been talking to his dad
C                 G
   It makes me so sad

And I have this dream where I am screaming underwater
          Em              C                D
While  my friends are all waving from the shore
G                   C                  G
I don't need you to tell me what that means
  C                D               G
I don't believe in that stuff anymore

Always have...

When I've bored myself to tears
        G                     C                 G
And we talk until we think we might just kill ourselves

But then we laugh until it disappears
 
G                        C      G
Last night I blacked out in my car
      Em               C        D
And I woke up in my childhood bed
        G                             C          G
Wishing I was someone else, feeling sorry for myself

And I remembered someone's kid is dead

You and I go rough, we keep
                        D
throwing things and slamming the
     Am
doors
                   Em
You and I get sore, then
                          D
dysfunctional we stuck keeping
      Am
score
                 Em
You and I get sick, they all know
                  D              Am
that we can't do this no more
 
 
[Chorus]

                        Em                D         Am
Trying to tell you stop, but your lipstick got me so out of breath
                        Em                D         Am
I'd be waking up, in the morning probably hating myself
                        Em                D         Am
And I'd be waking up, feeling satisfied but guilty as hell

   Life it seems will fade away,        drifting further every day.
   Am                   C               G                  Em
   Getting lost within myself,          nothing matters, no one else.
   Am                   C               G                  Em
   I have lost the will to live,        simply nothing more to give.
   Am                   C               G
   There is nothing more for me.        Need the end to set__

   Things not what they used to be,     missing one inside of me.
   Am                   C               G                  Em
   Deathly lost, this can't be real,    cannot stand this hell I feel.
   Am                   C               G                  Em
   Emptiness is filling me,             to the point of agony.
   Am                   C               G
   Growing darkness taking dawn,        I was me, but now__

If you don't use the suggested chord shapes below then be sure to keep the line cliche of the
progression of Gm Gbaug Bb/F Em7b5 similar as this is important to have mostly the same notes
and just have a descending chromatic bass line in this part.
Gm/F  xx3333 can be substituted for Bb/F, and E7b5  xx2330 (no3) can be substituted for Em7b5.

Can't you see that you're smothering me?

Holding too tightly, afraid to lose control
Em                             C
'Cause everything that you thought I would be

Better seen and not heard""

I won't just lay me down and die

[Verse]
Em          G
   I walk a lonely road
    D             A             Em
The only one that I have ever known
           G
Don't know where it goes
D                A               Em   G   D   A
But it's home to me and I walk alone
 
Em             G
   I walk this empty street
D            A                Em
On the boulevard of broken dreams
          G
Where the city sleeps
    D             A               Em   G
And I'm the only one and I walk alone
D         A             Em    G
  I walk alone, I walk alone
D         A
  I walk alone, I walk a-

  My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
C      G       D                Em
  My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
C      G       D                 Em
  Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me

Em             G
   I'm walking down the line
D               A               Em
That divides me somewhere in my mind
       G           D
On the border line of the edge
    A              Em   G   D   A
And where I walk alone
 
Em        G                D
   Read between the lines, what's

Fucked up and everything's all right
         G              D                A
Check my vital signs to know I'm still alive

One (American Recordings III)
By Marcel Veltman
 
Johnny Cash's version of this U2 song shows the way to mediocre musicians like myself
how to do it just as convincingly without unconvenient fingering on weird tunings and
without incredible range of voice. Brilliant.
 
 
[Intro]
 
Am  D  F  G
 
 
[Verse]
 
Am              D
  Is it getting better
F                    G
  Or do you feel the same
Am                 D
   Will it make it easier on you now
F                         G
   You got someone to blame
 
 
[Chorus]
 
         C
You said
         Am
One love
         F
One life
                    C
When it's one need
 
in the night
 
One love
           Am
We get to share it
     F
It leaves you baby
              C
If you don't care for it
 
 
[Instrumental]
 
Am  D  F  G
 
 
[Verse]
 
Am           D
Did I disappoint you
F                              G
Or leave a bad taste in your mouth
Am                      D
You act like you never had love
F                       G
And you want me to go without
 
 
[Chorus]
 
         C
Well it's
          Am
too late
        F
Tonight
                     C
To drag the past out
                 C
Into the light
 
We're one
          Am
But we're not the same
            F
We get to carry each other
C
Carry each other
 
One
 
 
[Instrumental]
 
Am  D  F  G
 
 
[Verse]
 
Am                      D
Have you come here for forgiveness
F                           G
Have you come to raise the dead
Am                           D
Have you come here to play Jesus
F                       G
To the lepers in your head
 
 
[Chorus]
 
          C
Did I ask
            Am
too much
                F
More than a lot
 
You gave me nothing
    C
Now it's all I got
 
We're one
           Am
But we're not the same
         F
Well, we hurt each other
           C
And we're doing it again
 
You say
 
 
[Bridge]
 
C
Love is a temple
Am
Love a higher law
C
Love is a temple
Am
Love the higher law
C
You ask me to enter
G
But then you make me crawl
                          F
And I can't be holding on
 
To what you got
                     C
When all you got is hurt
 
C
  One love
Am
  One blood
F
  One life
C
  You got to do what you should
C
  One life
Am
  With each other
F
  Sisters
C
  Brothers
C
  One life
Am
  But we're not the same
F
  We get to carry each other
C
  Carry each other
C       Am   F    C
  One
C       Am   F    C
  One

Capo Third Fret and use standard chords.
 
A couple of other tabs are right on the money with the
actual chords however this gets a little confusing when
using a capo. (Why complicate things) Just play the chords
on the third fret as if there were no capo... SIMPLE.

                                        G|-2-------2-------|
                                        D|-----------------|
                                        A|-----------------|
                                        E|-----------------|
 
The only plucking part of the song is the intro, the rest is strumming, you'll have
to listen to the song to find the rhythm. Good luck.
 
 
[Intro]
 
(Start plucking on the 'G' string, and say ""Hello"" on the third time you pluck
the 'B' string. The rest of the chords are above the corresponding syllables, just keep
the plucking rhythm while you transition.)
 
 
Dm                        C
    Hello darkness my old friend
                           Dm
I've come to talk with you again
          F          Bb      F
Because a vision softly creeping
                       Bb       F
Left his seeds while I was sleeping
        Bb                            F
And the vision that was planted in my brain
               Dm   F            C        Dm
Still remain          within the sound of silence.
 
 
[Verse 1]
 
                             C
In restless dreams I walked alone
                        Dm
Narrow streets of cobblestone
           F       Bb       F
'Neath the halo of a street lamp
                          Bb       F
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
        Bb                                       F
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
                       Dm   F                 C        Dm
That split the night          and touched the sound of silence.
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
                         C
And in the naked light I saw
                          Dm
Ten thousand people maybe more
       F           Bb       F
People talking without speaking
                   Bb        F
People hearing without listening
               Bb                      F
People writing songs that voices never share 
                  Dm   F             C        Dm
And no one dare          disturb the sound of silence
 
 
[Verse 3]
 
                        C
Fools said I you do not know
                      Dm
Silence like a cancer grows
        F            Bb          F
Hear my words that I might teach you
                    Bb          F
Take my arms that I might reach you
       Bb                          F
But my words like silent raindrops fell
Dm       F             C        Dm
     And echoed in the wells of silence
 
 
[Verse 4]
 
                         C
And the people bowed and prayed
                     Dm
To the neon god they made
        F                Bb      F
And the sign flashed out its warning
                     Bb      F
In the words that it was forming
 
And the sign said
    Bb                                              F
The words of the prophets are written on the subway walls
                     Dm       F                C         Dm
And tenement halls        and whispered in the sounds of silence

I remember what you wore on the first day
Am
You came into my life
               F
And I thought hey

You know this could be something
C
'Cause everything you do and words you say

C                 G
Back when I was a child
Am            F
Before life removed all the innocence
C               G
My father would lift me high
Am                F
And dance with my mother and me and then
C                     Am
Spin me around till I fell asleep
Dm                          Am
Then up the stairs he would carry me
      Dm
And I knew for sure
G
I was loved
 
 
[Chorus]
C              G
If I could get another chance
Am            F
Another walk, another dance with him

I'd play a song that would never, ever end

When I and my mother would disagree
Am                    F
To get my way I would run from her to him
C                          G
He'd make me laugh just to comfort me, yeah, yeah
Am                           F
Then finally make me do just what my mama said
C                       Am
Later that night when I was asleep
Dm                 Am
He left a dollar under my sheet
      Dm
Never dreamed that he
         G
Would be gone from me
 
 
[Chorus]
C                G
If I could steal one final glance
Am              F
One final step, one final dance with him

Sometimes I'd listen outside her door

LANDSLIDE (Stevie Nicks - Fleetwood Mac)
------------------------
A few notes:
 
I modified this from the awesome tab originally posted by indigo@cats.ucsc.edu (Adam Schneider)
I fixed a couple of verses where the chord progression was incorrect (probably cut & paste error).
I read a comment in the original post that says that the Solo is incorrect because it is tabbed from the nut
when the rest of the song is tabbed from Capo 3.  So, it would be logical to add 3 to every note in the tab;
but I don't play the solo on my acoustic so I don't know if that is correct or not.
 
 * Capo 3rd Fret
 
 * All the chords are one measure in duration, except ""Am7 - G/B,"" which is
one measure _total_.
 
 * D7/F# is 200212 but is easier to play as 20021x so you don't have to use your thumb.  I find it easiest if
I play it like an Am and move my middle finger to the Low E string in the 2nd Fret.  This works because the
picking pattern won't include the Hi E string anyway.  And, there is a transition from Am to D7/F# when she
sings ""Built my life around you"" so if you get in the habit of using the Am chord form, it is an easy
transition. (I think the chorus actually sounds better with the Am to D7/F# transition instead of Am7 to D7/F#
but either way sounds great)
 
Adam's original notes regarding the solor are below:
 * In the guitar solo, ""/"" is a slide, ""="" is a hammer-on or pull-off, and
the marks underneath are for timing.  The timing is pretty accurate.
 * Some of the places in the guitar solo where I put hammer-ons or pull-offs
should probably be bends (e.g., 10=12 should maybe be 10b12).  But I don't
have an electric guitar, so I can't do whole-step bends.
 * I might not have put the solo on the right strings; the _notes_ are
right, but where I notated a 3 on the E-string, it might really be an 8 on
the B string, and so on.  Use whichever fingering works best for you.

A|3-------3-------|2-------2-------|0-------0-------|2-------2-------|
E|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|
 
When you get to the last chord progression before the chorus (and the last chord progression of the solo,
just change the bass note string (played with your thumb) to the Low E string for the D7/F# chord as follows:
 
  D7/F#            D7/F#
E|----------------|----------------|
B|------1-------1-|------1-------1-|
G|--2-------2-----|--2-------2-----|

When picking the Em, Lindsey plays a slight variation of that picking pattern.
He alternates his thumb between the Low E and the A strings.
For the 2nd Em chord, in the 5th note of the picking pattern, he does a hammer-on on the B string.
The pattern looks like this:
 
  Em               Em

Can the child within my heart rise above?

Can I sail through the changin' ocean tides?
      C          G/B      Am7   G/B    C   G/B  Am7  G/B
Can I handle the seasons of my li    -  i  -    fe?

        C            G/B       Am7   G/B
Well, a landslide'll bring it down, oh-ohh
     C           G/B       Am7.
The landslide'll bring it down.

[Verse]
C                              FM7
Every night, I'm lying in bed, holding you close in my dreams
C                                               FM7
Thinking about all the things that we said, and coming apart at the seams
Em                 Dm           Em                 F/G
We try to talk it over, but the words come out too rough
  C                       Dm                       C     G7
I know you were trying to give me the best of your love
 
[Verse]
C                                      FM7
Beautiful faces, and loud empty places, look at the way that we live
C                                       FM7
Wasting our time on cheap talk and wine, left us so little to give
    Em                        Dm                   Em                    F/G
That same old crowd was like a cold dark cloud that we could never rise above
    C                   Dm                      C     G7
But here in my heart, I give you the best of my love
 
[Chorus]
           C                  Dm
Oh-oh-oh ohhhh, sweet darlin', you get the best of my love

Fm7                               C
I'm going back in time and it's a sweet dream
         Fm7                                             Dm    G7
It was a quiet night and I would be all right if I could go on sleeping
 
[Verse]
    C                                 FM7
But every morning I wake up and worry, what's gonna happen today?
C                                              FM7
You see it your way, and I see it mine, but we both see it slipping away
Em                          Dm         Em                      Dm   G7
You know we always had each other baby, I guess that wasn't enough; o-o-ohh
    C                   Dm                      C     G
But here in my heart, I give you the best of my love

C                            Em
Hey there Delilah, what’s it like in New York City?
      C                               Em
I’m a thousand miles away, but girl tonight you look so pretty,
        Am  F                  G                  Am
Yes you do, Times Square can’t shine as bright as you,
             G
I swear it’s true.
C                            Em
Hey there Delilah, don’t you worry about the distance,
          C                                  Em
I’m right there if you get lonely, give this song another listen,
           Am    F            G                Am
Close your eyes, listen to my voice it’s my disguise,
            G
I’m by your side.
 
 
[Chorus]
 
C                      Am  C                      Am
Oh it’s what you do to me, oh it’s what you do to me,

Oh it’s what you do to me, oh it’s what you do to me,

What you do to me.

Hey there Delilah, I know times are getting hard,
           C                                    Em
But just believe me girl some day, I'll pay the bills with this guitar,
              Am    F              G               Am
We'll have it good, we'll have the life we knew we would,
           G
My word is good.
C                           Em
Hey there Delilah, I’ve got so much left to say,
         C                                 Em
If every simple song I wrote to you, would take your breath away,
             Am   F            G                  Am
I’d write it all, even more in love with me you’d fall,
             G
We’d have it all.

C                      Am  C                      Am

[Bridge]
 
F                                      G
A thousand miles seems pretty far, but they’ve got planes and trains and cars,
C                                 Am
I’d walk to you if I had no other way.
F                                         G
Our friends would all make fun of us, and we'll just laugh along because,
   C                                     Am
We know that none of them have felt this way.
F                               G
Delilah I can promise you, that by the time that we get through,
    Am                                               G
The world will never ever be the same, and you’re to blame.
 
 
[Verse]

Hey there Delilah you be good, and don’t you miss me,
         C                                          Em
Two more years and you’ll be done with school, and I'll be making history,
Am        F                 G              Am
Like I do, you’ll know it's all because of you,
F             G            Am
We can do whatever we want to,
F           G               Am                  G
Hey there Delilah here's to you, this one’s for you.
 
 
[Chorus]
 
C                      Am  C                      Am
Oh it’s what you do to me, oh it’s what you do to me,
C                      Am  C                      Am
Oh it’s what you do to me, oh it’s what you do to me,

What you do to me.

E-A-D-E-B-E    (Just tune the G down to an E)
 
Capo 4
 
[Chords]
E       022000
F#m     244000
A       x02000
B       x24000
C#m     x46000
 
http://youtu.be/-_Hqn2uJALk?t=1m1s
 
On the A chord, he hammers the B string (2nd from highest), second fret - x02020
 
Technique stuff:
The F#m chord may sound a bit off, but it's the bass note that you should listen for.
Also, think of this song as 4 beats per line, but then subdivide every beat into 6
mini beats. That's how he plucks. For example, say ""Cheerio Cheerio"" for each
beat.
He likes to hit the bass note on the first beat of every chord, the G string on
the 2nd triplet (or the Chee of the second Cheerio), then the B string on the ""a""
of the 2nd triplet (1+a2+a) (or the ""O"" of the second Cheerio).
 
In the album version of this song, in the bridge (Lumière darling) the chords are C#m A E B.
 
[Verse]
E             F#m       A
  You look so wonderful in your dress
E            F#m       A
 I love your hair like that
E           F#m          A
 The way it falls on the side of your neck
C#m        B             A
 Down your shoulders and back
 
E         F#m          A
 We are surrounded by all of these lies
     E          F#m      A
 And people who talk too much
E                F#m     A
 You've got the kind of look in your eyes
       C#m         B            A
As if no one knows anything but us
 
[Pre-Chorus]
   A                  E            B
And should this be the last thing I see
  A                      E          B
I want you to know it's enough for me
       A                    E                  B
'Cause all that you are is all that I'll ever need

So in love
      E   F#m   A
So in love
 
[Verse]
E             F#m       A
 You look so beautiful in this light
E            F#m       A
 Your silhouette over me
E            F#m           A
 The way it brings out the blue in your eyes
       C#m     B    A
is the Tenerife Sea
    E          F#m        A
And all of the voices surrounding us here
          E             F#m         A
They just fade out when you take a breath
E             F#m        A
Just say the word and I will disappear
C#m      B          A
into the wilderness
 
[Pre-Chorus]

I want you to know it's enough for me

'Cause all that you are is all that I'll ever need
 
[Chorus]

I'm so in love
      E   F#m   A
So in love
      E   F#m   A
So in love
      E   F#m   A
So in love
 
[Bridge]
C#m A    E  B
Lumière, darling
C#m  A        B
Lumière over me

[Pre-Chorus]
   A                  E            B
And should this be the last thing I see
  A                      E          B
I want you to know it's enough for me
       A                    E                  B
'Cause all that you are is all that I'll ever need
 
[Outro]
          E   F#m   A
I'm so in love
      E   F#m   A
So in love
      E   F#m   A
So in love
      E   F#m   A
So in love
 
[Outro]
E            F#m       A
 You look so wonderful in your dress
E             F#m       A
 I loved your hair like that
E            F#m      A
 And in the moment I knew you Beth

[Verse 3]
Em                                       G       D
   We were searching for reasons to play by the rules
Em                                 G         D
   But we quickly found out it was just for fools
Em                                      G       D
   Now through all the sorrow, we'll be riding high
Am  C                                      C       Em  Em      D
    And the truth of the matter is I never let you go, let you go

[Verse 1]
 
D
Waiting, watching the clock
E
It's 4 o'clock, it's got to stop
D
Tell him, take no more
E
She practices her speech
F                    G
As he opens the door she rolls over
F                       G
Pretends to sleep as he looks her over
 
 
[Chorus]
 
D            A             G
She lies and says she's in love with him
D            A         G
Can't find a better man
D             A          G
She dreams in color, she dreams in red
D             A         G
Can't find a better man
D            A
Can't find a better man
D            A
Can't find a better man
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
D                   E
Talking to herself, there's no one else
                  D                 E
who needs to know she tells herself
D                           E
Memories, back when she was bold and strong
                   F        G
and waited for the world to come along
F                           G
Swears she knew it, now she swears he's gone
 
 
[Chorus]
 
D            A             G
She lies and says she's in love with him
D            A         G
Can't find a better man
D             A          G
She dreams in color, she dreams in red
             A         G
Can't find a better man
D            A             G
She lies and says she's in love with him
D            A         G
Can't find a better man
D             A          G
She dreams in color, she dreams in red
D            A

[Ending]
 
D              A   G
  She loved him....... yeah
D                 A         G
  She don't want to leave this way
D              A   G
  She needs him....... yeah
D                      A      G

I     am a man    of constant sorrow

I've seen trouble all my days
F             F                 Bb
I'll  bid farewell    to old Kentucky 
                C                  F
The place where I     was born and raised

No pleasure here on earth I found 
F             F                 Bb
For in this world I'm bound to ramble

I have no friends to help me down

For I'm bound to ride that northern railroad

My face you never will see no more

Fun - We Are Young
 
Notes*:
     -The Gm and Am at the end of verse 1 and
     the outro are just the triads of Gm and Am
     the low note of the chord isnt necessarily
     an A or a G.
 
     -I would only play the slash chords if your
     either trying to be super accurate or playing
     piano. Otherwise this isn't ease to sing and play
 
     -The Guitar during verse two plays power chords
     rather than the whole chord.
 
     -To make the song even easier you could tranpose
     the chords down 5 half-steps and play with a capo
     on the fifth fret.
 
 
[Verse 1]
 
F
Give me a second I, I need to get my story straight

The moon is on my side       I have no reason to run
                          C
So will someone come and carry me home tonight
F                           Dm                             F

Seven AM, the usual morning lineup

Then after lunch it's puzzles and darts and baking

Paper mache, a bit of ballet and chess

Pottery and ventriloquy, candle making

Then I'll stretch, maybe sketch, take a climb

Sew a dress!

G                Am
 There’s nothing stopping me
      C              D
 From going out with all of your best friends
G           Am      C          D
 And if you come around saying sorry to me
    G             Am           C            D
 My daddy’s gonna show you how sorry you’ll be

Cause I hate that stupid old pickup truck

You never let me drive
         G        Am
You’re a redneck, heartbreak
      C             D
Who’s really bad at lying
G           Am       C
So watch me strike a match

[Intro]
C
 
[Verse 1]
C
Early one mornin' while makin' the rounds,
                               G
I took a shot of cocaine and I shot my woman down.
  G
I went right home and I went to bed,
  C     N.C.
I stuck that lovin' .44 beneath my head.
 
[Verse 2]
C
Got up next mornin' and I grabbed that gun.
                            G
Took a shot of cocaine and away I run.
G
Made a good run but I run too slow,
     C   N.C.
they overtook me down in Juarez, Mexico.
 
[Verse 3]
C
Laid in the hot joints takin' the pill.
                           G
In walked the sheriff from Jericho Hill.
   G
He said Willie Lee, your name is not Jack Brown.
C      N.C.
You're the dirty hack that shot your woman down.
 
[Verse 4]
C
Said yes, oh yes, my name is Willie Lee.
                             G
If you've got a warrant just read it to me.
G
Shot her down because she made me slow.
  C       N.C.
I thought I was her daddy but she had five more.
 
[Verse 5]
C
When I was arrested, I was dressed in black. 
                                G
They put me on a train and they took me back. 
G
Had no friend for to go my bail. 
     C       N.C.
They slapped my dried up carcass in that county jail.
 
[Verse 6]
C
Early next mornin' 'bout a half past nine,
                         G
I spied a sheriff comin' down the line.
G
Upped and he coughed as he cleared his throat,
             C   N.C.
He said come on, you dirty hack, into that district court.
 
[Verse 7]
C
Into the courtroom my trial began
                    G
Where I was held by twelve honest men.
G
Just before the jury started out,
  C   N.C.
I saw that little judge commence to look about.
 
[Verse 8]
C
In about five minutes in walked a man
                       G
Holding the verdict in his right hand.
    G
The verdict read in the first degree,
  C  N.C.
I hollered lordy, lordy, have mercy on me.
 
[Verse 9]
C
The judge, he smiled as he picked up his pen.
                         G
Ninety-nine years in the Folsom pen.
G
Ninety-nine years underneath that ground,
  C     N.C.
I can't forget the day I shot that bad bitch down.
 
[Ending]
C                          F
Come all, you gotta listen unto me,
D                        G                C
lay off that whiskey and let that cocaine be.

[Verse 1] (Start strumming)
 
Em             D                C
   I couldn't tell you why she felt that way,  She felt it every day.
Em              D
And I couldn't help her,
       C
I just watched her make the same mistakes again.
 
Em
What's wrong, what's wrong now?
D
Too many, too many problems.
C                           C
Dont know where she belongs, where she belongs.
 
 
[Chorus]
 
Em               G                 D
 She wants to go home, but nobody's home
 
Its Where she lies, broken inside.
Em                   G               D
There's no place to go, no place to go to dry her eyes.
 
Broken inside.
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
Em          D                C
Open your eyes and look outside, find a reason why.
Em              D           C
You've been rejected, and now you can't find what you left behind.
Em
Be strong, be strong now.
D
Too many, too many problems.
C                           C
dont know where she belongs, where she belongs.
 
 
[Chorus]
 
Em               G                 D
She wants to go home, but nobody's home.
 
It's where she lies, broken inside.
Em                   G               D
With no place to go, no place to go to dry her eyes.
 
Broken inside.
 
 
[Bridge]
 
Em              D
Her feelings she hides.
                     C
Her dreams she can't find.
                C
shes losing her mind
              Em
She's fallen behind.
                   D
She can't find her place.
                 C
She's losing her faith
                  C
She's fallen from grace.
                   C
She's all over the place. Yeah, oh oh.
 
 
[Chorus]
 
Em               G                 D
 She wants to go home, but nobody's home.
 
It's where she lies, broken inside.
Em                   G               D
There's no place to go, no place to go to dry her eyes.
 
Broken inside.
 
 
[Outro]
 
Em          G            D
She's lost inside, lost inside...oh oh.
Em          G            D               Em
She's lost inside, lost inside...oh oh yeah.

[Verse 1]
 
(Play as intro with the hammer-ons)
 
F         C   F             C
 We might kiss when we are alone
F        C
 nobody's watching
         G            C
We might take it home
F         C        F             C
 We might make out when nobody's there
F                    C
 It's not that we're scared
                    G
It's just that it's delicate
 
 
[Chorus]
 
(Strum the chords, * = play with hammer-ons)
 
              F
So why do you fill my sorrow
         C
With the words you've borrowed
         F                 C *
From the only place you've known
               F
And why do you sing Hallelujah

If it means nothing to you

Why do you sing with me at all?

 When there's nothing to give

Well how can we ask for more
F         C         F              C
 We might make love in some sacred place

The look on your face is delicate

Capo II
 
[Verse 1]
 
         A               F#m            Bm          E7
In Penny Lane there is a barber showing photographs
         A                 F#m              Am
of ev'ry head he's had the pleasure to have known
                                 F           E7
And all the people that come and go stop and say hello
 
[Verse 2]
 
       A           F#m           Bm       E7
On the corner is a banker with a motor car.
           A                 F#m            Am
The little children laugh at him behind his back.
                             F          E7            D
And the banker never wears a mac in the pouring rain, very strange.
 
[Chorus]
 
      G             Bm             C    trumpet (G  Bm  C)
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
G                 Bm            C               E7
There beneath the blue suburban skies I sit and meanwhile back
 
[Verse 3]
 
         A               F#m             Bm         E7         A
In Penny Lane there is a fireman with an hour glass and in his pocket is a
F#m             Am
portrait of the queen.
                                 F             E7
He likes to keep his fire engine clean, it's a clean machine.
 
[Interlude] (piccolo trumpet)
 
A  F#m  D6  E  A  F#m  Am7
F#m7  Fmaj7  Esus4  E    D
 
[Chorus 2]
 
      G             Bm             C   (G  Bm  C)
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
  G                Bm     C               E7
A four of fish and finger pies in summer, meanwhile back
 
[Verse 4]
 
           A              F#m           Bm        E7
Behind the shelter in the middle of the roundabout
           A                F#m            Am
The pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray
                                      F
And though she feels as if she's in a play
       E7
She is anyway.
 
[Verse 5]
 
         A               F#m            Bm       E7
In Penny Lane the barber shaves another customer.
           A               F#m           Am
We see the banker sitting, waiting for a trim
                            F           E7
And then the fireman rushes in from the pouring rain,
D
very strange.
 
[Chorus]
 
      G             Bm             C   (G Bm C)
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
G                 Bm            C               E7
There beneath the blue suburban skies I sit and meanwhile back
 
[Outro]
 
      A             C#m            D    (A  C#m  D)
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
A                 C#m           D     (A  C#m  D)
There beneath the blue suburban skies.
      A

Stop me and steal my breath
D                        G

Never revealing their depth

Tell me that we belong together

     Em     G C          Asus2
Some-times, I feel, I've got to;
Em G     C         Asus2
   Run a-way, I've got to;
Em G     C
   Get A-way,
         Asus2       Em       G      C        Asus2
From the pain you drive in-to the heart of me.
 
    Em   G  C     Asus2
The love we share, seems to,
Em  G     C
    Go no-where.
G         Em   G  C    Asus2
 And I've lost my light,
      Em                     G
For I toss and turn; I can't sleep at night.
 
 
[Chorus]

 Once I ran to you, now I run from you,

 This tainted love you've given,

I give you all a boy could give you.

 Take my tears and that's not nearly...

    Asus2     Em              G
You don't really want any more from me.
 
   Em   G      C
To make things right,
    Asus2         Em     G        C
You need some-one to hold you tight.
Asus2        Em         G     C
 And you think love is to pray,
Asus2        Em             G
 But I'm sorry, I don't pray that way.

E                  G

 I've waited a hundred years 
                        F
I'd wait a million more for you
C
 Nothing prepared me for 
(C)
What the privilege of being yours 
F
Would do
 
[Chorus]
G         Am
 If I had only felt 
    F                  C     G
The warmth within your touch

If I had only seen 
        F              C     G
How you smile when you blush 
           Am
Or how you curl your lip 
         F           C
When you concentrate enough
             G
I would have known 
                  Am       F -once
What I was living for all along

C
 
[Verse]
C
 Your love is my turning page
                                  F
Where only the sweetest words remain
C                Em          Am
 Every kiss is a cursive line          
                 G         F
Every touch is a redefined phrase
 
[Chorus]
G  Am                 F
 I surrender who I've been
            C   G
For who you are
        Am                F
Nothing makes me stronger than
             C     G
Your fragile heart
         Am               F
If I had only felt how it feels
      C
To be yours
                  G
Then I would have known
                      Am      F
What I've been living for all along
                      C
What I've been living for
 
C     F
 
[Bridge] (get very soft at the end)
(F)                  G
Though we're tethered 
                     F
To the story we must tell
              G
When I saw you
                         F
Well I knew we'd tell it well
               G
With a whisper 
                         F
We will tame the vicious seas
              G
Like a feather 
                      C
Bring the Kingdoms to their knees

When we move, well, you already know
        Fm7                         Ab/Bb
So just imagine, just imagine, just imagine
 
 
[Chorus]
 
C                                  Am
Nothing I can see but you when you dance, dance, dance
F
A feeling good, good, creeping up on you
        Am
So just dance, dance, dance, come on
C
All those things I shouldn't do
        Am
But you dance, dance, dance
    F                                  Am
And ain't nobody leaving soon, so keep dancing
                 C
I can't stop the feeling
        Am
So just dance, dance, dance
                 F
I can't stop the feeling
        Am
So just dance, dance, dance, come on
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
C                   Am
Ooh, it's something magical
            F                                   Am
It's in the air, it's in my blood, it's rushing on
                C                     Am
I don't need no reason, don't need control
         F                                Am
I fly so high, no ceiling, when I'm in my zone
 
 
[Refrain]
 
                 C
Cause I got that sunshine in my pocket
              Am
Got that good soul in my feet
            F                            Am
I feel that hot blood in my body when it drops
  C                                    Am
I can't take my eyes up off it, moving so phenomenally
        F                                  Am
Room on lock, the way we rock it, so don't stop
 
 
[Pre Chorus]
 
              Bb/C                   C
And under the lights when everything goes
           Bb/C                      C
Nowhere to hide when I'm getting you close
        Ab/Bb                   Bb
When we move, well, you already know
        Fm7                         Ab/Bb
So just imagine, just imagine, just imagine
 
 
[Chorus]
 
C                                  Am
Nothing I can see but you when you dance, dance, dance

So just dance, dance, dance, come on
C
All those things I shouldn't do

Everybody sing

[Verse]
Em          D
Hush, don't speak
         Am                       C
When you spit your venom, keep it shut I hate it
         Em       D
When you hiss and preach
           Am                      C
About your new messiah 'cause your theories catch fire
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
Em                 D
I can't find those silver linings
Am              C
I don't mean to judge
    Em                 D
But when you read your speech, it's tiring
Am         C
Enough is enough
 
 
[Chorus]
    Em                      D
I'm covering my ears like a kid
          Am                       C
When your words mean nothing, I go la la la
    Em                            D
I'm turning up the volume when you speak
            Am                        C
Cause if my heart can't stop it, I'll find a way to block it

Yes our love is running out of time

I won't count the hours, rather be a coward
         Em        D
When our worlds collide
          Am                     C
I'm gonna drown you out before I lose my mind
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]

https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/shawn-james/through-the-valley-chords-1907637,beginner,E A D G B E,4th fret,[],"I used this version because it was the best I could find. Hope you enjoy it and play along.
The song may be played with no capo using G#m, C#m and D#7, but I recommend a capo on the
4th fret to make it easier for you.
 
With capo on 4th fret - Em -> fingerpick - 6, 4, 2, 3, 4
                        Am B7 -> fingerpick - 5, 4, 2, 3, 4

[Verse]
Em                           Am
I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
    Em                          B7
And I fear no evil because I'm blind to it all
        Em                          Am
And my mind and my gun they comfort me
          Em                  B7               Em
Because I know I'll kill my enemies when they come
 
Em                                                Am
Surely goodness and mercy will follow me all the days of my life
            Em                      B7
and I will dwell on this earth forevermore.
        Em                                     Am
Said I walk beside the still waters and they restore my soul.
             Em                      B7                 Em
But I can't walk on the path of the right because I am wrong
 
         Em                                Am
Well, I came upon a man at the top of the hill
Em                                      B7
called himself the savior of the human race
         Em                              Am
said he come to save the world from destruction and pain
             Em                    B7          Em
but I said, ""how can you save the world from itself?""
 
[Instrumental]
Em Am
Em B7
Em Am
Em B7 Em
 
[Outro]
          Em                        Am
'Cause I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
       Em                      B7
and I fear no evil 'cause I'm blind.
           Em                                      Am
Oh, and I walk beside the still waters and they restore my soul,
       Em          B7              Em
but I know when I die my soul is damned.

Here's the modified chords that I throw in for kicks:
G  (320033)
C* (x32013)
 
[Verse 1]
G               Bm     C            G
Puff, the magic dragon lived by the sea
    C                G      Em        A7                 D7
And frolicked in the autumn mist in a land called Honah Lee,
G             Bm    C                 G
Little Jackie Paper loved that rascal Puff,
    C                       G       Em      A7     D    G      D
And brought him strings and sealing wax and other fancy stuff, oh!
 
[Chorus]
G               Bm     C            G
Puff, the magic dragon lived by the sea
    C                G      Em        A7                D7
And frolicked in the autumn mist in a land called Honah Lee,
G               Bm     C            G
Puff, the magic dragon lived by the sea
    C                G      Em        A7          D     G    D
And frolicked in the autumn mist in a land called Honah Lee.
 
[Verse 2]
  G                 Bm          C                  G
Together they would travel on a boat with billowed sail
C             G          Em      A7              D7
Jackie kept a lookout perched on Puff’s gigantic tail,
G               Bm            C                 G
Noble kings and princes would bow whene'er they came,
C                  G           Em         A7          D       G     D
Pirate ships would lower their flags when Puff roared out his name, oh!
 
[Chorus]
G               Bm     C            G
Puff, the magic dragon lived by the sea
    C                G      Em        A7                D7
And frolicked in the autumn mist in a land called Honah Lee,
G               Bm     C            G
Puff, the magic dragon lived by the sea
    C                G      Em        A7          D     G    D
And frolicked in the autumn mist in a land called Honah Lee.
 
[Verse 3]
  G               Bm       C             G
A dragon lives forever but not so little boys
C                 G     Em         A7            D7
Painted wings and giant rings make way for other toys.
G                 Bm                C            G
One grey night it happened, Jackie Paper came no more
    C                G     Em   A7         D        G     D
And Puff that mighty dragon, he ceased his fearless roar.
 
[Verse 4]
    G                Bm      C                      G
His head was bent in sorrow, green scales fell like rain,
C              G       Em    A7              D7
Puff no longer went to play along the cherry lane.
    G                 Bm      C                 G
Without his life-long friend, Puff could not be brave,
   C                G      Em    A7        D      G     D
So Puff that mighty dragon sadly slipped into his cave, oh!
 
[Chorus]
G               Bm     C            G
Puff, the magic dragon lived by the sea
    C                G      Em        A7                D7
And frolicked in the autumn mist in a land called Honah Lee,
G               Bm     C            G
Puff, the magic dragon lived by the sea
    C                G      Em        A7          D     G    C   G
And frolicked in the autumn mist in a land called Honah Lee.

The first Noel

The angels did say

Was to certain poor

Shepherds in fields as they lay:

In fields where they

Lay keeping their sheep

They looked up

Shining in the east beyond them far:

And to the earth

Three wise men came from the country far;
   G          D
To seek for a King
    C       G
Was their intent,
       C          G/B       C   D    G
And to follow the star wherever it went.

To the north-west;

O'er Bethlehem it took its rest,

Both stop and stay,

Right over the place where Jesus lay.

And we should be together babe, but we're not
G                       F#m7
I play it off but I'm dreaming of you
Em7                             A
And I'll keep my cool but I'm feigning
 
[Chorus]
                D
I try to say goodbye and I choke
              Asus
I try to walk away and I stumble
                 Em7
Though I try to hide it, it's clear
            G                       A
My world crumbles when you are not near
   D
Goodbye and I choke
            Asus
Try to walk away and I stumble
                 Em7
Though I try to hide it, it's clear
            G
My world crumbles when you are not near
 
[Verse 2]
D                   A
I may appear to be free
                  Em
But I'm just a prisoner of your love
                  D                         A
And I may seem alright and smile when you leave
                   Em7
But my smiles are just a front, just a front
G                      F#m7
I play it off but I'm dreaming of you
Em7                             A
And I'll keep my cool but I'm feigning
 
[Chorus]

My world crumbles when you are not near

Goodbye and I choke

Try to walk away and I stumble

Here is my confession, May I be your possession

Boy I need your touch, your love kisses and such
                    Bm7                   Em
With all my might I try but this I can't deny, deny
G                       F#m7
I play it off but I'm dreaming of you

[Verse]
 
G        D           Em             C
  Napatunganga nung bigla kitang nakita 
      G          D          Em - C
pagkalipas ng mahabang panahon
G             D                Em        C
  High School pa tayo nung una kang makilala
       G            D         Em               C
at tandang-tanda ko pa noon pa may sobrang lupit mo na
G                D             Em                C
  Hindi ko alang alam kung pano basta biglang nagsama tayo
G         D           Em       C
  di nagtagal ay napaibig mo ako
 
G        D           Em             C
Mula umaga hanggang uwian natin laging magkasama tayong dalawa
      G          D          Em - C
parang kahapon lang nangyari sa akin ang lahat 
G             D                Em        C
tila isang tulang medyo romantiko ang banat
G                D             Em                C
ngunit ng napag-usapan bigla na lang nagkahiyaan
G         D           Em       C
mula noon hindi na tayo nag-pansinan
 
 
[Chorus]
 
   G        D              Em
At bakit ko ba pinabayaan 
             C             G
mawala ng hindi inaasahan
          D
parang nasayang lang 
     Em N.C.   C            G - D - Em - C  (x2)
nawala na      wala ng nagawa
 
 
[Verse]
 
G         D           Em       C
Panay ang plano ngunit panay ang urong
G         D           Em       C
at inabot na ng dulo ng taon
G         D           Em       C
Graduation natin nung biglang nag-absent partner ko
G         D           Em       C
tadhana nga naman naging mag-partner tayo
G         D
eksakto na ang timing
 Em       C
planado na ang sasabihin
G         D
ngunit hanggang huli
 Em       C
wala akong nasabi
 
 
[Chorus]
 
   G        D              Em
At bakit ko ba pinabayaan

pagkalipas ng mahabang panahon
G         D           Em       C
sobrang alam ko na ang aking sasabihin
G         D           Em       C
at akoy napailing sa ganda ng ngiti mo sa akin
G         D           Em       C
at ng ikaw ay nilapitan
G         D           Em       C
bigla na lang napaligiran
G         D           Em       C
ng yong mga anak mula sa
G         D           Em       C
pangit mong asawa

Album: 1989
Track 13
2014
 
Standard Tuning
Capo on the 4th fret
 
 
[Intro]
 
C    G    Am    F
 
C    G    Am    F
 
 
[Verse 1]
 
C       G                        Am    F
  The drought was the very worst
C            G                 Am            F
  When the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst
C          G                             Am    F
  It was months, and months of back and forth
C                  G               Am                         F
  You're still all over me like a wine-stained dress I can't wear anymore
 
 
[Pre-Chorus 1]
 
 G                  F                      G                     F
Hung my head, as I lost the war, and sky turned to black like a perfect storm
 
 
[Chorus]
 
 C          G      Am
Rain came pouring down when I was drowning
  F                            C
That's when I could finally breathe
        G        Am                        F                      C
And by morning, gone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
C            G                 Am    F
  There was nothing left to do
C           G                     Am                F
  When the butterflies turned to dust that covered my whole room
C        G                        Am    F
  So I punched a hole in the roof
C           G          Am            F
  Let the flood carry away all my pictures of you
 
 
[Pre-Chorus 2]
 
     G                F                   G               F
The water filled my lungs, I screamed so loud but no one heard a thing
 
 
[Chorus]
 
 C          G      Am
Rain came pouring down when I was drowning
  F                            C
That's when I could finally breathe
        G        Am                        F                      C
And by morning, gone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean
G                      Am      F
I think I am finally clean
C      G                      Am    F
  Said I think I am finally clean
 
 
[Bridge]
 
C
10 months sober, I must admit
F
Just because you're clean don't mean you don't miss it
C
10 months older, I won't give in
F
Now that I'm clean I'm never gonna risk it
C        G                       Am    F
  The drought was the very worst
C            G                 Am            F
  When the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst
 
 
[Chorus]
 
 C          G      Am
Rain came pouring down when I was drowning
  F                            C
That's when I could finally breathe
        G        Am                        F
And by morning, gone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean
 
 C          G      Am
Rain came pouring down when I was drowning
  F                            C
That's when I could finally breathe
        G        Am                        F                      C
And by morning, gone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean
 
G           Am    F
  Finally clean
                    C    G    Am
Think I'm finally clean
F                     C
  Think I'm finally clean

[Verse]
C         Dm         Am
Pinaiyak ka ng manghuhula
C         Dm         Am
Di na daw tayong magkasamang  tatanda
        C         Dm           Am
Buti nalang meron langit na nagtatangol
         F                      Dm
sa pag-ibig na porsigido't matiyaga
 
[Chorus]

Sasalubungin natin ang kinabukasan
             C            Gm   Dm
Nang Walang takot at walang pangamba
               C            Gm   Dm
Tadhana meron tip na makapangyarihan

Kung ayaw may dahilan,

G   D   Em   C
 
[Verse 1]
G
Well, you done done me and you bet I felt it,
D
I tried to be chill but you're so hot that I melted
Em                                     C
I fell right through the cracks, now I'm trying to get back
G
Before the cool done run out I'll be giving it my bestest
D
Nothing's going to stop me but divine intervention
Em                             C
I reckon it's again my turn to win some or learn some
 
[Chorus 1]
G                  D          Em
But I won't hesitate no more, no more
          C
It cannot wait, I'm yours
 
G   D   Em   C
 
[Verse 2]
G                                    D
Well, open up your mind and see like me
                                   Em
Open up your plans and then you're free
                                     C
Look into your heart and you'll find love love love love
G                                                    D
Listen to the music of the moment people, dance and sing
                   Em
We're just one big family
                                       C                      A7
And it's our God-forsaken right to be loved loved loved loved loved
 
[Chorus 2]
G                D                Em
So I won't hesitate no more, no more
             C
It cannot wait, I'm sure
G                              D
There's no need to complicate, our time is short
Em                C
This is our fate, I'm yours
 
[Bridge]
G              D/F#
D-D-do do you, but do you, D-D-do
Em
But do you want to come on
D                     C
Scooch on over closer dear
                      C#dim
And I will nibble your ear
 
[Interlude]
G   D/F#  Em   D
C         C#dim
 
[Verse 3]
G
I've been spending way too long checking my tongue in the mirror
D
And bending over backwards just to try to see it clearer
Em
But my breath fogged up the glass
C
And so I drew a new face and I laughed
G
I guess what I be saying is there ain't no better reason
D
To rid yourself of vanities and just go with the seasons
Em                      C
It's what we aim to do, our name is our virtue
 
[Chorus 1]
  G               D           Em
But I won't hesitate no more, no more
                C
It cannot wait, I'm yours
 
[Verse 4]
G                               D
Well, open up your mind and see like me
                                   Em
Open up your plans and damn you're free
                                      C
Look into your heart and you'll find that the sky is yours
G                          D
There's no need to complicate
                    Em
'Cause our time is short
            C
This is our fate
          A7
I'm yours

G                               Em
     Over the mountains and the sea,
                              C
Your river runs with love for me,
                      D
and I will open up my heart
                          G
and let the Healer set me free.
                       Em
I'm happy to be in the truth,
                         C
and I will daily lift my hands:
                          D
for I will always sing of when
 
Your love came down.
 
 
[Chorus]
 
G                         D
     I could sing of Your love forever
Em                        C
     I could sing of Your love forever
G                         D

     Oh, I feel like dancing - hey yeaah
Em                      Bm
     it's foolishness I know;
Am                           C
     but, when the world has seen the light,
          D
they will dance with joy,
 
like we're dancing now.

[Verse 1]
    C
An empty street
    G
An empty house
   Em             Am
A hole inside my heart
     F
I'm all alone
     F                  G

I wonder how

And hope my dreams will take me there

To see you once again my love

Overseas from coast to coast

Em                           C       Am
  Have you got color in your cheeks?
Am                                       Em
Do you ever get that fear that you can't shift
 
The type that sticks around like summat in your teeth?
               C           Am
Are there some aces up your sleeve?
                                Em
Have you no idea that you're in deep?
 
I dreamt about you nearly every night this week
         C              Am
How many secrets can you keep?
                                      Em
'Cause there's this tune I found that makes me think of you somehow and I play it on repeat

 Until I fall asleep

If this feeling flows both ways?

      C
(Baby we both know)
         Am                                 Em
That the nights were mainly made for saying things that you can't say tomorrow day
 
 
[Chorus]
 
                 Em
Crawling back to you
                C      Am
Ever thought of calling when you've had a few?
                Em
'Cause I always do
                         C       Am
Maybe I'm too busy being yours to fall for somebody new
                    Em
Now I've thought it through
                 Em
Crawling back to you
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
                    C     Am
So have you got the guts?
                                     Em
Been wondering if your heart's still open and if so I wanna know what time it shuts
C               Am
 Simmer down and pucker up
                             Em                                           C        Am
I'm sorry to interrupt. It's just I'm constantly on the cusp of trying to kiss you
                             Em
I don't know if you feel the same as I do
                  C   Am             B
But we could be together if you wanted to
 
 
[Bridge]
 
     C
(Do I wanna know)
        Am
If this feeling flows both ways?
        Em
(Sad to see you go)
 
Was sort of hoping that you'd stay
      C
(Baby we both know)
         Am                                 Em
That the nights were mainly made for saying things that you can't say tomorrow day
 
 
[Chorus]
 
                 Em
Crawling back to you
                C      Am
Ever thought of calling when you've had a few?
                Em
'Cause I always do
                         C       Am
Maybe I'm too busy being yours to fall for somebody new
                    Em
Now I've thought it through
                 C
Crawling back to you
           (Do I wanna know?)
        Am
If this feeling flows both ways?
        Em
(Sad to see you go)
 
Was sort of hoping that you'd stay
      C
(Baby we both know)
         Am                                 Em
That the nights were mainly made for saying things that you can't say tomorrow day
 
 
[Outro]
 
      C
(Do I wanna know?)
               Am
Too busy being yours to fall
        Em
(Sad to see you go)
                C      Am
Ever thought of calling darling?
      Em
(Do I wanna know?)
               C       Am      Em
Do you want me crawling back to you?

[Verse]
 
                    Dsus2/F#
Stumbled 'round the block a thousand times
                  A
You missed every call that I had tried, so now I'm giving up
Bm
A heartbreak in mid December
    G
You don't give a fuck, you never remember me
Dsus2/F#                       A
While you're pulling on his jeans
                        Bm
Getting lost in the big city
                       G
I was looking out our window
                 Dsus2/F#                           A
Watching all the cars go, wondering if I'll see Chicago
                   Bm
Or a sunset on the West-Coast
                 G
Or will I die in the cold
                   Dsus2/F#
Feeling blue and alone
             A
I wonder if you'll ever hear this song on your stereo
 
 
[Chorus]
 
Dsus2/F#                        A
I hope you get your ballroom floor,
                                   Bm
Your perfect house with rose-red doors,
                           G
I'm the last thing you remember,
 
I's been a long lonely December.
 
Dsus2/F#                       A
I wish I'd known that less is more,
                             Bm
But I was passed out on the floor,
                               G
And that's the last thing I remember,
 
It's been a long lonely December.
 
 
[Verse]
 
Dsus2/F#
Cast me aside to show yourself in a better light,
                                                 A
I came out grieving, barely breathing and you came out alright.
         Bm
But I'm sure you'll take his hand,
             G
I hope he's better than I ever could've been,
   Dsus2/F#
My mistakes were not intentions,
           A                               Dsus2/F#   G
This is a list of my confessions I couldn't say
 
Pain is never permanent, but tonight it's killing me
 
 
Chorus:
Dsus2/F#                        A
I hope you get your ballroom floor,
                                   Bm
Your perfect house with rose-red doors,
                           G
I'm the last thing you remember,
 
I's been a long lonely December.
 
Dsus2/F#                       A
I wish I'd known that less is more,
                             Bm
But I was passed out on the floor,
                               G
And that's the last thing I remember,
 
It's been a long lonely December.
 
 
[Bridge]
 
(Only play the * chords once)
 
Dsus2/F#*                         A*
I miss your face, you're in my head
                                         Bm*
There's so many things that I should've said,
                            G*
A year of suffering, a lesson learned.
 
Dsus2/F#                        A
I miss your face, you're in my head
                                         Bm
There's so many things that I should've said,
                            G
A year of suffering, a lesson learned.
 
 
[Chorus]
 
Dsus2/F#                        A
I hope you get your ballroom floor,

Your perfect house with rose-red doors,
                           G
I'm the last thing you remember,

[Verse 1]
G                Em             C           G
When it rains it pours, but you didn't even notice

I wrote this tab before the song came out publicly so the chords/lyrics might be
slightly different than what is out now.  For my ear the other chords/tabs listed
do not sound right so I figured I'd share these incase others relate.  Hopefully
you like it.  Comments can be sent to my email listed above.

          Bm          Asus4
Some even fall to the earth
            G      D
We’ve got a lot to learn
                A (Hammer onto sus2 and back off)
God knows we’re worth it
               G
No I won’t give up
 
 
[Bridge]
 
        E
I don’t wanna be someone who walks away so easily
                                              Dadd9
I’m here to stay and make the difference that I can make
   E
Our differences they do a lot to teach us how to use the tools and gifts we got
             Dadd9
Yeah we got a lot at stake
           C
And in the end, you’re still my friend at least we didn’t tend
                                               C#m9
For us to work we didn’t break, we didn’t burn
                                                        C
We had to learn, how to bend without the world caving in
                          C#m9
I had to learn what I got, and what I’m not
          D – Dsus4 - D
And who I am
 
 
[Chorus 2]
 
“FINGER PICK” Freestyle pick.  If requested I’ll type the pattern I use
             G     D
I won’t give up on us

Even if the skies get rough
               G      D
I’m giving you all my love

Hardly do we ever fight

We’d rather be kind

[1st VERSE: riff-1]
 
Dm            Dsus4     Dm
Mama, she has taught me well
C                  Am Asus2
Told me when I was young
Dm                  Dsus4 Dm
Son, your life's an open book
      C                   Am Asus4
Don't close it 'fore it's done
    Dm                    Dsus4 Dm
The brightest flame burns quickest
   C                Am Asus2
Is what I heard her say
  Dm          Dsus4    Dm
A son's heart sewed to mother
    C              Am
But I must find my way
 
 
[CHORUS: riff-2]
 
Dm  C  Am    G
Let my heart go
Dm  C    Am  G
Let your son grow
      Dm  C  Am    G
Mama, let my heart go
   Dm  C    Bb    G  Am Asus2
Or let this heart be still
 
 
[2nd VERSE: riff-1]
 
Dm             Dsus4 Dm
Rebel my new last name
C                Am Asus2
Wild blood in my veins
Dm             Dsus4    Dm
Apron strings around my neck
    C                 Am Asus4
The mark that still remains
Dm              Dsus4 Dm
Left home at an early age
   C                Am Asus4
Of what I heard was wrong
  Dm             Dsus4 Dm
I never asked forgiveness
    C               Am
But what is said is done
 
 
[CHORUS: riff-2]
 
(last line ends on Asus4 instead of Asus2)
 
Dm  C  Am    G
Let my heart go
Dm  C    Am  G
Let your son grow
      Dm  C  Am    G
Mama, let my heart go
   Dm  C    Bb    G  Am Asus4
Or let this heart be still
 
 
[BRIDGE: riff-3]
 
Dm      G
Never I ask of you
    C       F
But never I gave
        Dm           G
But you gave me your emptiness
      C          F
I now take to my grave
Dm      G
Never I ask of you
    C       F
But never I gave
        Dm           G
But you gave me your emptiness

So let this heart be still
 
 
[3rd VERSE: riff-1]
 
Dm            Dsus4  Dm
Mama, now I'm coming home
        C                 Am Asus2
I'm not all you wished of me
  Dm                Dsus4 Dm
A mother's love for her son
C               Am Asus2
Spoken, help me be
        Dm                 Dsus4 Dm
Well, I took your love for granted
            C                  Am Asus4
And all the things you said to me
  Dm                Dsus4   Dm
I need your arms to welcome me
      C                Am
But a cold stone's all I see
 
 
[CHORUS: riff-1]
 
(last line ends on Asus4 instead of Asus2):
 
N.C.         G
Let my heart go
Dm  C    Am  G
Let your son grow
      Dm  C  Am    G
Mama, let my heart go
   Dm  C    Bb    G  Am Asus4
Or let this heart be still
 
 
[CHORUS: riff-1]
 
Dm  C  Am    Dm
Let my heart go
      Dm  C  Am    Dm
Mama, let my heart go
          Dm  C  Am    Dm  Dsus4 Dm
You never let my heart go
   Dm  C    Bb    G  Am
So let this heart be still
 
 
[ENDING: riff-3]
 
(last line fades out on Am):
 
Dm      G
Never I ask of you
    C       F
But never I gave
        Dm           G
But you gave me your emptiness
      C          F
I now take to my grave
Dm      G
Never I ask of you

[Verse 1]
 
                     C
And this is how it starts
                                             F          G
You take your shoes off in the back of my van
                        C
My shirt looks so good
                                     F         G
When it's just hanging off your back
          C
She said use your hands and my spare time
           G                            Am7
We've got one thing in common it's this tongue of mine
         F                                 G
She said she's got a boyfriend anyway
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
C
There's only minutes before I drop you off
                                       F
And all we seem to do it talk about sex
 
She's got a boyfriend anyway
            G
She's got a boyfriend anyway
   C
I love your friend when I saw his film
                                                              F
He's got a funny face but I like that because he still looks cool
 
She's got a boyfriend anyway
      G                       F
She's got a boyfriend anyway
 
 
[Chorus]
 
                              G
Now we are on the bed in my room
G
And I'm about to fill his shoes
     Am7
But you say no
G
You say no
F                        G
Does he take care of you
G
Or could I easily fill his shoes
    Am7
You say no
G
You say no

[Verse 3]
 
C                                  G
And now we're just outside of town
             Am7                 F
And you're making your way down
F
She's got a boyfriend anyway
            G
She's got a boyfriend anyway
C
And I'm not trying to stop you love
               G               Am7                       F
But if we're gonna do anything we might as well just ....
F
She's got a boyfriend anyway
            G
She's got a boyfriend anyway
 
C                                     G
You've got your tongue pierced anyway
            Am7             F
You in your hightops anyway
                                G
You in your skinny jeans anyway
C                               G
You and your fit friends anyway
               Am7            F
I'd take them all out any day
 
They've all got back combs anyway
                 G               C
You've all got boyfriends anyway

Maybe it's the way she walked
F                      C         G  (down stroke twice on G)
Straight into my heart and stole it
F                          C   G
Through the doors and past the guards
F                  C        G
Just like she already owned it
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
         F                       G
I said, ""Can you give it back to me?""

The mama pajama rolled out of bed,
                          D
and she ran to the police station
         E
When the papa found out, he began to shout,
                          A
and he started the investigation
 
                 E
It's against the law;
                   A
it was against the law
              E
What the mama saw;
                   A
it was against the law
 
    A
The mama looked down and spit on the ground,
                        D
every time my name gets mentioned
    E
The papa said oy, if I get that boy,
                                      A
I'm gonna stick him in the house of detention

Whoa, in a couple of days, they come and take me away,
                            D
but the press let the story leak
             E
Now when the radical priest, come to get me released,
                           A
we was all on the cover of Newsweek
 
               D

[Verse 1]
                    G                        Cadd9
I say remember this moment in the back of my mind
                            Em
The time we stood with our shaking hands
     D                      Cadd9
The crowds in stands went wild
                          G
We were the kings and the queens
                      Cadd9
And they read off our names
                              Em
The night you danced like you knew our lives
       D              Cadd9
Would never be the same
                           Em                      Cadd9
You held your head like a hero on a history book page
                     Em   D                      Cadd9
It was the end of a decade but the start of an age
 
[Chorus]
      G                         Cadd9
Long live the walls we crashed through
                        Em                      D
How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
                        G                      Cadd9
I was screaming, ""long live all the magic we made""
                           Em
And bring on all the pretenders
     Cadd9               G
One day, we will be remembered
 
[Verse 2]
                        G                            Cadd9
I said remember this feeling, I passed the pictures around
                          Em                 D
Of all the years that we stood there on the sidelines
             Cadd9
Wishing for right now
                          G                                           Cadd9
We are the kings and the queens, you traded your baseball cap for a crown
                       Em              D                    Cadd9
When they gave us our trophies and we held them up for our town
                    Em                               Cadd9
And the cynics were outraged, screaming, ""this is absurd!""
                       Em
'Cause for a moment a band of thieves
   D                       Cadd9
In ripped up jeans got to rule the world
 
[Chorus]
      G                         Cadd9
Long live the walls we crashed through
                        Em                      D
How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
                        G                      Cadd9
I was screaming, ""long live all the magic we made""
                           Em                D
And bring on all the pretenders, I'm not afraid
      G                         Cadd9
Long live all the mountains we moved
                      Em
I had the time of my life
                       D
Fighting dragons with you
                        G                     Cadd9
I was screaming, ""long live that look on your face""
                           Em
And bring on all the pretenders
     C                   G
One day, we will be remembered
 
[Bridge]
Cadd9        Em
Hold on to spinning around
    Cadd9 Em
Confetti falls to the ground
          Cadd9
May these memories break our fall
 
[Verse 3]
                 G
Can you take a moment?
            Cadd9
Promise me this:
                           Em
That you'll stand by me forever
         D                           Cadd9
But if, God forbid, fate should step in
                     G
And force us into a goodbye
                          Cadd9
If you have children someday
                          Em    D
When they point to the pictures
                     Cadd9
Please tell them my name
                  Cadd9
Tell them how the crowds went wild
                D
Tell them how I hope they shine
 
[Chorus]
      G                         Cadd9
Long live the walls we crashed through
                      Em        D
I had the time of my life with you
            G                         Cadd9
Long, long live the walls we crashed through
                        Em                      D
How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
                        G                      Cadd9
I was screaming, ""long live all the magic we made""
                           Em                D
And bring on all the pretenders, I'm not afraid
              G                           Cadd9
Singing long live all the mountains we moved
                      Em
I had the time of my life
                       D
Fighting dragons with you
            G                      Cadd9
Long, long live that look on your face
                           Em
And bring on all the pretenders
     Cadd9    N.C.

                Asus2
My heart’s been far from you

Ten-thousand miles gone
 
Oh, I wanna come near and give ya

Every part of me
 
But there's blood on my hands
                       E
And my lips are unclean
 
In my darkness I remember
                           Asus2
Momma’s words reoccur to me
 
""Surrender to the good Lord
                             F#m
And he’ll wipe your slate clean""

Take me to your river

I wanna go

Oh-oh-oh- oh

Take me to your river

[Verse]
 
E
Dip me in your smooth waters
 
I go in
     Asus2
As a man with many crimes
 
Come up for air
                         E
As my sins flow down the Jordan
 
 
Oh, I wanna come near and give ya
                Asus2
Every part of me
 
But there is blood on my hands
                    F#m

Stairway To Heaven
(Page/Plant)
 
 
[Intro]
 
| Am   Cmaj7/G# | C/G   D/F#  | Fmaj7     | Am/B Am
 
 
[Verse]
 
Fmaj7      Am      Cmaj7/G#         C/G        D/F#
There's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold
Fmaj7                         Am/B  Am
And she's buying a stairway to heaven
Fmaj7     Am           Cmaj7/G#        C/G            D/F#
When she gets there she knows, if the stores are all closed
Fmaj7                           Am/B   Am
With a word she can get what she came for
C  D Fmaj7 Am          C        G          Dsus4  D
Ooh, ooh,    and she's buying a stairway to heaven
 
Am        Cmaj7      D              Fmaj7      Am
There's a sign on the wall but she wants to be sure
Am          C              D             Fmaj7
'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings
Fmaj7  Am      Cmaj7/G#           C/G          D/F#
In a tree by the brook, there's a songbird who sings,
D/F#       C                     Am/B Am
Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven
 
 
[Bridge]
 
Am7    Am   Dsus2   D              Am7   Am   Em  D  C   D
                 Ooh, it makes me wonder
Am7    Am   Dsus2   D              Am7   Am   Em  D  C   D
                 Ooh, it makes me wonder
 
 
[Verse]
 
D           C      G/B         Asus2 Am
There's a feeling I get when I look to the west,
Am       C       G/B      Fmaj7#11  Am
And my spirit is crying for leaving
Am     C     G/B                   Asus2    Am
In my thoughts I have seen rings of smoke through the trees,
Am       C     G/B              Fmaj7  Am
And the voices of those who stand looking
 
 
[Bridge]
 
Am7    Am   Dsus2   D              Am7   Am   Em  D  C   D
                 Ooh, it makes me wonder
Am7    Am   Dsus2   D                    Am7   Am   Em  D  C   D
                 Ooh, it really makes me wonder
 
 
[Verse]
 
D         C             G/B      Asus2 Am
And it's whispered that soon if we all call the tune
D         C         G/B    Fmaj7#11
Then the piper will lead us to reason
D         C             G/B      Asus2 Am
And a new day will dawn for those who stand long
D         C         G/B    Fmaj7#11
And the forests will echo with laughter
 
C            G/B            Am                 Am/B
If there's a bustle in your hedgerow, don't be alarmed now,
C           G/B                 Fmaj7  Am
It's just a spring clean for the May Queen
C              G/B               Am               Am/B
Yes, there are two paths you can go by, but in the long run
C             G/B               Fmaj7      Am
There's still time to change the road you're on
 
 
[Bridge]
 
Am7    Am   Dsus2   D              Am7   Am   Em  D  C   D

Am7    Am   Dsus2   D                    Am7   Am   Em  D  C   D
                 Ooh, it really makes me wonder
 
 
[Verse]

And as we wind on down the road
Am          G              F     G/G#
Our shadows taller than our soul

There walks a lady we all know
Am                G                 F    G/G#
Who shines white light and wants to show
Am        G                   F     G/G#
How everything still turns to gold
Am         G           F      G/G#
And if you listen very hard
Am           G               F      G/G#
The tune will come to you at last
Am           G              F      G/G#
When all are one and one is all
Am       G               F      G/G#
To be a rock and not to roll
