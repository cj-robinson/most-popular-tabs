Play: G
Key: Ab
 
For chords in original key transpose this chord sheet +1 (and ""use flats"").
 
Play this song with the regular shapes of the chords given in this song
or use the ones that can be heard on the recording:
 
      E-A-D-G-B-e
G     3-x-0-0-3(3)
Em    0-2-2-0-3(3) (= Em7)
C     x-3-2-0-3(3) (= Cadd9)
[Coda]
Dsus4 x-x-0-2-3-3 or x-x-0-0-3-3 (= a D chord which is neither major nor minor)
G/B   x-2-0-0-0-3  (= G chord with a ""b"" as the root)
D/F#  2-x-0-2-3-x  (= D chord with a ""f#"" as the root)

[Verse 1]
          G        Em
I found a love for me
              C                            D
Darling, just dive right in, and follow my lead
                G          Em
Well, I found a girl beautiful and sweet
        C                                     D
I never knew you were the someone waiting for me
 
[Pre-Chorus]
                                G
Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
            Em                      C                G  D
Not knowing what it was, I will not give you up this ti-ime
             G                           Em
Darling just kiss me slow, your heart is all I own
            C                     D
And in your eyes you're holding mine
 
[Chorus]
      Em   C             G          D              Em
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
C                G     D                Em
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song
          C                G                 D              Em
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
         C                G        D          G
But you heard it, darling you look perfect tonight

[Verse 2]
                G                    Em
Well, I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know
              C                                          D
She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home
           G             Em
I found a love, to carry more than just my secrets
         C                              D
To carry love, to carry children of our own
 
[Pre-Chorus]
                             G                     Em
We are still kids, but we're so in love, fighting against all odds
             C               G  D
I know we'll be alright this ti-ime
             G                              Em
Darling just hold my hand, be my girl, I'll be your man
         C               D
I see my future in your eyes
 
[Chorus]
      Em   C              G         D              Em
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
C                G     D                Em
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song
        C                G                D
When I saw you in that dress, looking so beautiful
  Em       C                  G        D          G
I don't deserve this, darling you look perfect tonight

C                G     D                Em
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song
        C              G               D             Em
I have faith in what I see, now I know I have met an angel
    C          G         D
In person, and she looks perfect
 
[Outro]
  G/B     C           Dsus4    D          G
I don't deserve this, you look perfect tonight

[Verse 1]
  C                 Am
I heard there was a secret chord
     C                   Am
That David played and it pleased the Lord
    F                G               C        G
But you don't really care for music, do you?
        C                  F           G
Well it goes like this the fourth, the fifth
    Am                 F
The minor fall and the major lift
    G            E7             Am
The baffled king composing hallelujah
 
[Chorus]
     F           Am          F           C    G   C      Am C Am
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelu-u-u-u-jah ....
 
[Verse 2]
           C                        Am
Well, your faith was strong but you needed proof
    C               Am
You saw her bathing on the roof
    F              G             C            G
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you
    C               F       G
She tied you to her kitchen chair
    Am                        F
She broke your throne and she cut your hair
    G                  E7            Am
And from your lips she drew the hallelujah
 
[Chorus]
     F           Am          F           C    G   C      Am C Am
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelu-u-u-u-jah ....
 
[Verse 3]
C               Am
Baby, I've been here before
     C                       Am
I've seen this room and I've walked this floor
  F             G             C          G
I used to live alone before I knew you
     C                     F      G
I've seen your flag on the marble arch
    Am               F
But love is not a victory march
       G               E7          Am
It's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah
 
[Chorus]
     F           Am          F           C    G   C      Am C Am
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelu-u-u-u-jah ....
 
[Verse 4]
            C                   Am
Well, there was a time when you let me know
       C            Am
What's really going on below
    F             G               C        G
But now you never show that to me do you
      C             F        G
But remember when I moved in you
        Am            F
And the holy dove was moving too
    G               E7            Am
And every breath we drew was hallelujah
 
[Chorus]
     F           Am          F           C    G   C      Am C Am

[Verse 5]
      C               Am
Well, maybe there's a God above
    C             Am
But all I've ever learned from love
    F                G           C          G
Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew you
     C                  F       G
It's not a cry that you hear at night
     Am                 F
It's not somebody who's seen the light
       G               E7          Am
It's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah
 
[Outro]
     F           Am          F           C    G   C
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelu-u-u-u ....
     F           Am          F           C    G   C
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelu-u-u-u ....
     F           Am          F           C    G   C
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelu-u-u-u-jah ....
Am        F   G     C
     Halleluuuuuuujah

              G                          Am
Only hate the road when you're missin' home

[Chorus] (One Strum)
                         F                           C
'Cause you only need the light when it's burning low
              G                       Am
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
               F                           C       G
Only know you love her when you let her go
N.C.
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
 
Only hate the road when you're missin' home
 
Only know you love her when you let her go
 
And you let her go

Well, you done done me in; you bet I felt it

           G
Before the cool done run out, I'll be givin' it my bestest

and nothin's gonna stop me but divine intervention

I reckon it's again my turn

To win some or learn some

  Well, open up your mind and see like me

Open up your plans and damn you're free

Look into your heart and you'll find love, love, love, love

[Verse 3]
                   G
I've been spending way too long checking my tongue in the mirror
    D
And bending over backwards just to try to see it clearer
    Em
But my breath fogged up the glass
         C
And so I drew a new face and I laughed
  G
I guess what I'll be saying is there ain't no better reason
   D
To rid yourself of vanities and just go with the seasons
   Em
It's what we aim to do
    C
Our name is our virtue
 
[Chorus]
    G           D Dsus4

It cannot wait; I'm yours

Open up your plans and damn you're free

Look into your heart and you'll find that the sky is yours
   G
So please don't, please don't, please don't
           D        Dsus4
There's no need to complicate
           Em
'Cause our time is short

Am G C
Am G C
 
[Verse 1]
Am              G                C
I was scared of dentists and the dark
Am              G                C
I was scared of pretty girls and starting conversations
    Am         G               C
Oh, all my friends are turning green
           Am          G                 C
You're the magician's assistant in their dreams
 
[Pre-chorus]
Am   G    C
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Am   G             C
Ooh, ooh, and they come unstuck
 
[Chorus]
Am    G                   C
Lady, running down to the riptide, taken away
       Am         G               C
To the dark side, I wanna be your left hand man
  Am       G                        C
I love you when you're singing that song, and I got a lump
      Am             G                       C
In my throat, 'cause you're gonna sing the words wrong
 
[Verse 2]
Am                 G                   C
There's this movie that I think you'll like
     Am             G                C
This guy decides to quit his job and heads to New York City
     Am       G            C
This cowboy's running from himself
    Am                G                C
And she's been living on the highest shelf
 
[Pre-chorus]
Am   G    C
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Am   G             C
Ooh, ooh, and they come unstuck

I swear she's destined for the screen
