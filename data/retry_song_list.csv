Cause I'd rather be alone
   A
If I can't have you right now
      D        Dsus2 D  Dsus4 D  Dsus2 D
I'll wait, dear
C
  Sometimes I get so tense
      G
But I can't speed up the time
    A
But you know love, there's one more thing
       D   Dsus2 D  Dsus4  D  Dsus2  D
To consider

You and I’ll just use a little patience
C             G
  Said sugar, take the time
          C                    Em
Cause the lights are shining bright
C                G                 D     Dsus2 D  Dsus4  D  Dsus2
You and I've got what it takes to make it

We won't fake it

D
  I've been walking the streets tonight
G
  Just trying to get it right
D
  It's hard to see with so many around
    G
You know I don’t like being stuck in the crowd
        D
And the streets don't change but maybe the names
G
  I ain't got time for the game
         D
Cause I need you

[Chorus]
N.C.     Cadd9
When I'm away from you
                 E7
I'm happier than ever
                         Am
Wish I could explain it better
                 Dm7    G
I wish it wasn't true, mmm
 
         Cadd9
Give me a day or two
                       E7
To think of something clever
                 Am
To write myself a letter
                  Dm7  G
To tell me what to do,  mm-mm
 
 
[Verse 1]
C
  Do you read my interviews?
   E7
Or do you skip my avenue?
     Am
When you said you were passin' through
      Dm7b5
Was I even on your way?
   C
I knew when I asked you to (When I asked you to)
    E7
Be cool about what I was tellin' you
      Am
You'd do the opposite of what you said you'd do (What you said you'd do)
       Dm7b5
And I'd end up more afraid
               E7
Don't say it isn't fair
                                   Am      Am/G   D/F#
You clearly weren't aware that you made me miserable, ooh
           Dm7          G7
So if you really wanna know
 
 
[Chorus]
         Cadd9
When I'm away from you (When I'm away from you)
                  E7
I'm happier than ever (I'm happier than ever)
                         Am
Wish I could explain it better (Wish I could explain it better)
                 Dm7    G      C
I wish it wasn't true, mmm

You called me again, drunk in your Benz

Drivin' home under the influence

You scared me to death but I'm wastin' my breath

'Cause you only listen to your fuckin' friends
C                    E7
I don't relate to you
Am                     F
I don't relate to you, no
                  C               E7
'Cause I'd never treat me this shitty
            Am            F
You made me hate this city
 
 
[Bridge]
                  C                      E7
And I don't talk shit about you on the internet

Never told anyone anything bad
                     C                        E7
'Cause that shit's embarrassing, you were my everything
                 Am                       F
And all that you did was make me fuckin' sad
   C                             E7
So don't waste the time I don't have
    Am                         F
And don't try to make me feel bad
                    C                         E7
I could talk about every time that you showed up on time
                 Am                          F
But I'd have an empty line 'cause you never did
               C                     E7
Never paid any mind to my mother or friends, so I
              Am                          F
Shut them all out for you 'cause I was a kid
 
 
[Outro]
C                      E7
You ruined everything good
        Am                     F
Always said you were misunderstood
C                        E7
Made all my moments your own
Am                     F
Just fuckin' leave me alone

     Dm      Am7  Gm7 Am7            Dm   Am7  Gm7 Am7
When you require streetcar desire for higher heights.
 
Gm7             Am7                    Dm     Dm/Db  Am7/C   Am7/B

When sentiment is left to chance.
Gm7             Am7                    Dm
No place to be ending but somewhere to start.

Across the north and south, to Key Largo, love for sale.
 
 
[Verse]
Face to face, each classic case.
 
We shadow box and double cross,
 
Yet need the chase.
""""Some where here is the guitar, sax solo"" ""Dorfun make it your own
solo""
 
Gm7                     Am7    Dm
A license to love, insurance to hold.
Gm7                             Am7       Dm
Melts all your memories and change into gold.
Gm7                     Am7              Dm
His eyes are like angels but his heart is cold.

Some people long for a life that is simple and planned

To follow what's written
    E          A          D     E
But I'd follow you to the great unknown
E   C#/E# F#m      D        E

[Verse 1]
Bm
    I guess I grew up on an old dirt road
F#
Pedal to the metal, always did what I’s told
E7
'Til I found out that my brand new clothes
     F#
Came second hand from the rich kids next door
       Bm
When I grew up fast, I guess I grew up mean
          F#
There's a thousand things inside my head I wish I ain't seen
     E7
And now I just wandered through a real bad dream
F#
Feelin' like I'm comin' apart at the seams
 
[Chorus]
      Bm
Well, thank you Jack Daniels, Old Number Seven
F#
Tennessee Whiskey got me drinkin' in heaven and uh,
E7
  Angels start to look good to me
               F#
They're gonna have to deport me to the fiery deep
Bm
Thank you Jack Daniels, Old Number Seven
F#
Tennessee Whiskey got me drinkin' in heaven and uh,
E7
     I know I can't stay here too long
        F#                                    Bm
'Cause I can't go a week without doin' wrong
              F#
Without doin' wrong (Old Number Seven)
              E7
Without doin' wrong (Drinkin' in heaven)
              F#
Without doin' wrong (Old Number Seven)

       Bm
So I'm sitting as the bar stool, it starts to grow roots
F#
Feelin' like an old worn out pair of shoes
E7
Tell me what is it I should do
         F#
When I'm swimming in the liquor only half way through
       Bm
So I'm watching as his wings spread as wide as could be
F#
Come on now and wrap them around me
        E7
'Cause all I want to do now is fall to sleep
F#
Come down here and lay next to me, awww
 
[Chorus]
Bm
Thank you Jack Daniels, Old Number Seven
F#
Tennessee Whiskey got me drinkin' in heaven and uh,
E7
    Up here the bottle never runs dry
         F#
And you never wake up with those tears in your eyes, aww
Bm
Thank you Jack Daniels, Old Number Seven
F#
Tennessee Whiskey got me drinkin' in heaven and uh,
E7
Angels start to look good to me
F#                                              Bm
They're gonna have to deport me to the fiery deeps (Old Number Seven)
             F#
To the fiery deeps (Drinkin' in heaven)
             E7
To the fiery deeps (Old Number Seven)
             F#
To the fiery deeps (Drinkin' in heaven)

And there were flashes of light

There were things I'd never do again

And whenever you tried to hurt me
       Am            Dm
I just hurt you even worse

And so much deeper

There were hours that just went on for days

But you were history with the slamming of the door

And I made myself so strong again somehow
      Em           Am        F       G         Fsus2
And I never wasted any of my time on you since then

Then we see what we want to see

If I forgive you all that

We forgive and forget

And it's all coming back to me

someone else might find them useful.
Seems to fit well enough with the album version.

  Gonna put the world away for a minute
G
  Pretend I don't live in it
D                A              D
  Sunshine gonna wash my blues away
D
  Had sweet love but I lost it
G
  She got too close so I fought her
        Bm          A               G         A      D
Now I'm lost in the world trying to find me a better way

             D
Wishing I was knee deep in the water somewhere

Got the blue sky breeze and it don't seem fair
     D                          A                   D
Only worry in the world: Is the tide gonna reach my chair?

  Sunrise, there's a fire in the sky
      G
Never been so happy
      G
Never felt so high
      Bm                 A           G           A   D

G
  Bought a boat and I sailed off in it

Don't think anybody's gonna miss me anyway

  Mind on a permanent vacation
G
  The ocean is my only medication

Wishing my condition ain't ever gonna go away

Cause now I'm knee deep in the water somewhere

Got the blue sky breeze blowing wind through my hair

This champagne shore washing over me

It's a sweet sweet life living by the salty sea
G                       D
One day you could be as lost as me
              E
Change your geography
      A
Maybe you might be...
 
[Chorus]
D
  Knee deep in the water somewhere

Got the blue sky breeze blowing wind through my hair

  Sunrise, there's a fire in the sky

Come on in, the water's nice

Find yourself a little slice

And yo I know some things you things that you ain't told me

And from the two that we choose to do

Peace will win
 
And fear will lose

There's faith and there's sleep
    F                       G
We need to pick one please because
Am
Faith is to be awake
            G
And to be awake is for us to think
                F
And for us to think is to be alive
            F
And I will try with every rhyme
     G     Am
To come across like I am dying
             G                       F
To let you know you need to try to think

Let’s Marvin Gaye and get it on

You got the healing that I want
                             F
Just like they say it in the song
          G                                  C  G
Until the dawn, let’s Marvin Gaye and get it on
                         C
You got to give it up to me
                           Am
I'm screaming mercy, mercy please
                             F

[Verse 2 - Meghan Trainor]
 
                          C
And when you leave me all alone
                           Am
I'm like a stray without a home
                         F
I'm like a dog without a bone
G                      C
I just want you for my own, I got to have you babe
 
 
[Bridge]

Woah
        E7
There's loving in your eyes
     Am
That pulls me closer

It's so subtle, I'm in trouble
        Dm                         G         N/C
But I'd love to be in trouble with you

Let’s Marvin Gaye and get it on
                           Am
I got that healing that you want
                             F

Until the dawn, let’s Marvin Gaye and get it on

[Verse]
 
        C                      G                D/A
She was sittin' all alone over on the tailgate, tan legs swingin' by a Georgia plate
      C                          G                          D/A
I was lookin' for her boyfriend, thinkin', no way she ain't got one
        C                G                          D                          Em    D
Soon as I sat down I was fallin' in love, tryin' to pour a little sugar in her Dixie cup
        C                        G                       D
Talkin' over the speakers in the back of that truck, she jumped up and cut me off
 
 
[Chorus]
 
              C          G                          D                      Em        D
She was like, oh my God, this is my song, I've been listenin' to the radio all night long
C                          G                 D
Sittin' 'round waitin' for it to come on and here it is
              C              G                    D                      Em        D
She was like, come here boy, I wanna dance, 'fore I said a word, she was takin' my hand
C                   G                     D
Spinnin' me around 'til it faded out, and she gave me a kiss
              C              G                           D
And she said, play it again, play it again, play it again
            C              G                           D

[Verse 2]
 
         C            G             D
I'd have gave that DJ my last dime, if he would have played it just one more time
      C                   G                               D
But a little while later, we were sittin' in the drive in my truck
         C                       G                          D       Em D
Before I walked her to the door, I was scannin' like a fool AM, FM, XM too
      C                         G                  D
But I stopped real quick when I heard that groove, man, you should have seen her light up
 
 
[Chorus]
 
              C          G                           D                      Em        D
She was like, oh my God, this is my song, We've been listenin' to the radio all night long
C                       G                 D
I can't believe that it came back on, but here it is.
              C              G                    D                      Em        D
She was like, come here boy, I wanna dance, 'fore I said a word, she was takin' my hand
C                          G             D
Spinnin' in the headlights she gave me a goodnight kiss

C                          G             D
Spinnin' in the headlights she gave me a goodnight kiss

For the last Chorus/Outro, I move the Capo up a further 2 frets, so that it's on 4th fret
and play the same chords as in the previous Choruses 'cause I think it
sounds better and it's easier. But, it's up to you, I guess.
Leave a comment, if you have any corrections :D

                        A
Makes my wanna pull all my hair out
        C#m          B
Like he doesn't even care
 
 
[Pre-chorus]
 
 A
You, me, we're face to face
       B
But we don't see eye to eye
 
 
[Chorus]
 
   E
Like fire and rain (Fire and rain)
   B
You can drive me insane (You can drive me insane)
      C#m               B           A
But I can't stay mad at you for anything
      E
We're Venus and Mars (Venus and Mars)
         B
We're like different stars (Different stars)
               C#m         B         F#
But you're the harmony to every song I sing
       D                 E
And I wouldn't change a thing
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
E
  She's always tryna' save the day
B
  Just wanna let the music play
A
She's all or nothing
       C#m            B
But my feelings never change
E                          B
Why does he try to read my mind?
                          A
You try to pick up fight, to get attention
       C#m             B
That's what all of my friends say
 
 
[Pre-chorus]
 
A
You, me, we're face to face

And I wouldn't change a thing
 
 
[Bridge]
 
D                        D
  When I'm yes, she's no
                             E
When I hold on, he just lets go
D                           D
  We're perfectly imperfect
                         E
But I wouldn't change a thing, no
 
 
[Chorus]
 
   F#
Like fire and rain (Fire and rain)
   C#
You can drive me insane (You can drive me insane)
      D#m               C#          B
But I can't stay mad at you for anything
      F#
We're Venus and Mars (Venus and Mars)
         C#
We're like different stars (Different stars)

[Intro]
 
E   G#m7   F#m7   A B
 
 
[Verse]
 
               E
You’ve got the best of both worlds
G#m7                                F#m7
    You’re the kind of girl who can take down a man
    A              B
And lift him back up again
        E                         G#m7
You are strong, but you’re needy, humble but you’re greedy
    F#m7                                     A                  B
And based on your body language and shouted cursive I’ve been reading
     E                                  G#m7
Your style is quite selective, but your mind is rather reckless
        F#m7                                A         B
Well, I guess it just suggests that this is just what happiness is.
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
 
A                                 B
  Hey, what a beautiful mess this is.
A                                B  A/C#  B/D#
  It’s like picking up trash in dresses
 
 
[Chorus]
 
        E                      G#m7
Well it kind of hurts when the kind of words you write
F#m7              A          B
Kind of turn themselves into knives
         E                     G#m7
And don't mind my nerve you can call it fiction
        F#m7                            A       B    F#7  B7
‘Cause I like being submerged in your contradictions dear
       A       F#7  A       E*
‘Cause here we are, here we are
 
 
[Interlude]
 
E*   G#m7   F#m7  A B
 
 
[Verse]
 
    E                       G#m7
Although you were biased I love your advice
     F#m7                                         A                 B
Your comebacks they’re quick and probably have to do with your insecurities
            E                       G#m7
There’s no shame in being crazy, depending on how you take these
F#m7                             A              B
Words that paraphrasing this relationship we’re staging
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
 
A                                   B
  And it’s a beautiful mess, yes it is
A                                     B  A/C#  B/D#   B7
  It’s like, we are picking up trash in dresses
 
 
[Chorus]
 
        E                      G#m7
Well it kind of hurts when the kind of words you say
F#m7              A           B
Kind of turn themselves into blades
        E                       G#m7
And the kind and courteous is a life I’ve heard
         F#m7                A             B
But it’s nice to say that we played in the dirt
     F#7    A       F#7           A   B
Cause here, here we are, Here we are
 
 
[Verse]
 
E            G#m7         F#m7         A       B
Here we are, here we are, here we are, here we are
E            G#m7         F#m7         A           B    A
Here we are, here we are, here we are, we’re still here
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
 
A                           B
  And what a beautiful mess this is
A                                   B      A/C#   B/D# B7
  It’s like taking a guess when the only answer is yes
 
 
[Chorus]
 
            E                 G#m7
And through timeless words in priceless pictures
      F#m7           A         B
We’ll fly like birds not of this earth
    E                   G#m7
And tides they turn and hearts disfigure
          F#m7                   A           B
But that’s no concern when we’re wounded together
       E                    G#m7
And we tore our dresses and stained our shirts
         F#m7               A           B
But it’s nice today, oh the wait was so worth it

[Chorus]
(G)                     D
What are you listening to?

Where there's na na na's and air guitar
G                                D

Or the kind that you can't help singin' along
         G
Singin' whoa-oh-oh-ohhhhhh

Is it headphones on on a downtown train

Or the window seat on an outbound plane

Is it LA sunny or Memphis blue

I wish I knew, I wish I knew

[VERSE 1:]
      G       Em           C   D       G
When peace like a river attendeth my way
      Em           A           D
When sorrows like sea billows roll
    G        C              A            D
Whatever my lot, Thou hast taught me to say
       G           C    D       G
It is well, it is well with my soul
 
 
[CHORUS:]
       G    D   C    G
It is well (it is well)
      G        D    C    G
With my soul (with my soul)
    G   C           G    D      G
It is well, it is well with my soul
 
 
[VERSE 2:]
        G            Em               C  D         G
Though Satan should buffet, though trials should come
         Em       A         D
Let this blest assurance control
        G           C        A         D
That Christ has regarded my helpless estate
         G           C      D      G
And has shed His own blood for my soul
 
 
[VERSE 3:]
   G           Em                C  D      G
My sin - O, the bliss of this glorious thought
   Em            A            D
My sin - not in part but the whole
    G              C          A          D
Is nailed to the cross and I bear it no more
             G               C    D     G
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, O my soul
 
 
[VERSE 4:]
      G          Em                 C     D        G
And, Lord haste the day when the faith shall be sight
         Em               A         D
The clouds be rolled back as a scroll
     G            C              A          D
The trump shall resound and the Lord shall descend
     G           C     D      G
Even so - it is well with my soul

Artist Name: Green Day
 
This is a simplified version of the song that is played using 4 Main Chords and 1
Additional Chord at the end of each chorus. The additional chord is B7, though you
can play E7 instead if you find B7 too hard to play for now.
 
This is recommended for beginner guitarist to practice and learn the song before
moving to more advanced chord progressions and styling.
 
Transpose Up 1 half steps using the Ultimate-Guitar transposing tool to change the
chords below so you can play with the original Green Day version without a capo.
 
Alternatively Capo the 1st fret and use the chords below to play with the original
Green Day version.

    G          Cadd9  D         G
As time passes by, direction unknown
G              Cadd9    D          G
You've left us now but we're not alone
G          Cadd9         D         G
Before you know it your cups overflown
G            Cadd9       D           G
You measured no one that I've ever known
 
 
        Cadd9  D  G
And it's quite alright
      Cadd9  D   Em
And goodbye for now

We always knew that it'd come to this
G               Cadd9      D          G
It's times like these I forget what I miss
G          Cadd9     D         G
Matters of heart are hard to address
  G             Cadd9         D       G
Especially when yours is full of emptiness
 
        Cadd9  D   G
And it's quite alright
      Cadd9  D   Em
And goodbye for now
          C
Just look up to the stars
       D
And believe who you are

Your ears are full, but you're empty
Am                E (Guitar Fill 1)
Holding out your heart
