Capo on first fret
 
 
[Verse 1]
 
   C
I never knew
    Em              G             C
I never knew that everything was falling through
        Em        G               C
That everyone I knew was waiting on a queue
    Em       G               Am   Em        D
To turn and run when all I needed was the truth
                     C
But that's how it's got to be
       Em              G               C
It's coming down to nothing more than apathy
      Em             G              C
I'd rather run the other way than stay and see
      Em        G           Am     G        D
The smoke and who's still standing when it clears
 
 
[Chorus]
 
C    G    Em        G
Everyone knows I'm in
C        G     Em      D
Over my head, over my head
       C    G              Em     G
With eight seconds left in overtime
      C        G          Em   D    C
She's on your mind, she's on your mind
 
Em  G  C
Em  G
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
         C
Let's rearrange
   Em              G                C
I wish you were a stranger I could disengage
    Em           G              C
To say that we agree and then never change
    Em   G            Am        Em    D
Soften a bit until we all just get along
            C
But that's disregard
     Em           G              C
You find another friend and you discard
        Em          G          C
As you lose the argument in a cable car
     Em   G            Am    G     D
Hanging above as the canyon comes between
 
 
[Chorus]
 
C    G    Em        G
Everyone knows I'm in
C        G     Em      D
Over my head, over my head
       C    G              Em     G
With eight seconds left in overtime
      C        G          Em       D
She's on your mind, she's on your mind
 
C    G    Em        G
Everyone knows I'm in
C        G     Em      D
Over my head, over my head
       C    G              Em     G
With eight seconds left in overtime
      C        G          Em  D
She's on your mind, she's on, oh
 
 
[Bridge 1]
 
       C          Em       G           C
And suddenly I become a part of your past
       Em          G              C
I'm becoming the part that don't last
      Em    G             Am
I'm losing you and it's effortless
 
 
[Verse 3]
 
C                        Em            G
Without a sound we lose sight of the ground 
         C
In the throw around
         Em              G         C
Never thought that you wanted to bring it down
        Em         G            Am
I won't let it go down till we torch it ourselves
 
 
[Bridge 2]
 
G         G/F#
Everyone knows I'm in
Em7             C
Over my head, over my head
       C    G              Em   G
With eight seconds left in overtime
      Am       G          Em  D    C      Em
She's on your mind, she's on your mind...
G          C    Em         G       C
Everyone knows...   she's on your mind...
Em                 G         C
Everyone knows I'm in over my head
             Em          G
I'm in over my head, I'm over my...
 
 
[Chorus]
 
C    G    Em        G
Everyone knows I'm in
C        G     Em      D
Over my head, over my head
       C    G              Em     G
With eight seconds left in overtime
      C        G          Em   D  (C)
She's on your mind, she's on your mind
 
C      Em   G   x4

[Verse 1]
 
G
I wanna be drunk when I wake up
                  D/F#     Em
On the right side of the wrong bed
 
And never an excuse I made up
 
Tell you the truth I hate
      C
What didn't kill me
                          D   G
It never made me stronger at all
 
G
Love will scar your make-up lip sticks to me
             D/F#      Em
So now I'll maybe lean back there
                                  C
I'm sat here wishing I was sober
                                     D   G
I know I'll never hold you like I used to
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
 
       Em                       D
But a house gets cold when you cut the heating
 G                             C
Without you to hold I'll be freezing
Em                D
Can't rely on my heart to beat in
G                                  C
'Cause you take parts of it every evening
Em                        D
Take words out of my mouth just from breathing
G                                       C       G
Replace with phrases like ""when you're leaving me?""
 
       D/A        C
Should I, should I?
 
 
[Chorus]
 
               Em       G
Maybe I'll get drunk again
       Em        G
I'll be drunk again
       Em        G
I'll be drunk again
                  C  D
To feel a little love
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
G
I wanna hold your heart in both hands
                                        D/F#    Em
Not watch it fizzle at the bottom of a Coke can
 
And I've got no plans for the weekend
 
So should we speak then?
                         C
Keep it between friends?
                                               D   G
Though I know you'll never love me like you used to
 
G
There may be other people like us
                                           D/F#   Em
Who see the flicker of a clipper when they light up
                                                C
Flames just create us, burns don't heal like before
                             D  G
And you don't hold me anymore
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
 
    Em                     D
On cold days cold plays out like the band's the name
G                  C
I know I can't heal things with a hand shake
 Em                   D
You know I can change as I began saying
G                  C
You cut me wide open like a landscape
Em                D
Open bottles of beer but never champagne
G                         C             G
To applaud you with the sound that my hands make
 
       D/A        C
Should I, should I?
 
 
[Chorus]
 
               Em       G
Maybe I'll get drunk again
       Em        G
I'll be drunk again
       Em        G
I'll be drunk again
                 C  D
To feel a little love
 
 
[Bridge]
 
Em         G
All by myself
 
I'm here again
Em         G
All by myself
 
You know I'll never change
Em         G
All by myself
C       D   Em
All by myself
         Em      G
I'm just drunk again
         Em      G
I'll be drunk again
         Em      G
I'll be drunk again

To feel a little love

your demons, and all the non believers, the plans that they have made?""

Because one day I'll leave you,

Sometimes I get the feeling she's watching over me.

And when you're gone we want you all to know.

[Verse 1]
 
(G)    D          C     G
In the town where I was born
Em      Am       C        D
Lived a man who sailed to sea
G      D       C      G
And he told us of his life
Em     Am      C    D
In the land of submarines
 
G     D         C      G
So we sailed up to the sun
Em      Am        C      D
Till we found the sea of green
G      D       C         G
And we lived beneath the waves
Em     Am     C    D
In our yellow submarine
 
 
[Chorus]
 
G                D
We all live in a yellow submarine
D                 G
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
G                D
We all live in a yellow submarine
D                 G
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
G       D           C      G
And our friends are all on board
Em   Am           C         D
Many more of them live next door
G       D      C       G
And the band begins to play

As we live a life of ease (a life of ease)
Em   Am                              C      D
Everyone of us (every one of us) has all we need (has all we need)

E               Asus2             E              Asus2
Sheets of empty canvas, untouched sheets of clay
     E                 A              E
Were laid spread out before me as her body once did
 
E           Asus2          E               Asus2
All five horizons revolved around her soul as the earth to the sun
E             A                       E
Now the air I tasted and breathed has taken a turn
 
[Pre-chorus 1]
C                                    Em
Oh, and all I taught her was everything

Oh, I know she gave me all that she wore

And now my bitter hands,

Chafe beneath the clouds
            Em
Of what was everything
        D
All the pictures have
          C
All been washed in black
               Em
Tattooed everything
 
[Verse 2]
E        Asus2                E               Asus2
I take a walk outside, I'm surrounded by some kids at play
E                A            E
I can feel their laughter, so why do I sear
 
[Pre-chorus 2]

Oh, and twisted thoughts that spin 'round my head, I'm spinning, oh

I'm spinning, how quick the sun can drop away

All the pictures have

All been washed in black
             Em
Tattooed everything
        D
All the love gone bad
          C
Turned my world to black
                 D
And tattooed all I see,
         C
All that I am,

All that I'll be

I know someday you'll have a beautiful life,

I know you'll be a star in somebody else's sky
    Em        D            C
But why, why, why can't it be,

Notes: In the original version the whole song is played in dropped D and begins
       with an E chord. If you want to play like in the original, you must tune your
       guitar one step down and transpose the chords one step up.
       You can mute strings in the intro and verse and play normally in the 'yeah'
       lines - it will make playing more dynamic.

When the silence isn’t quiet
Am                     F
And it feels like it’s getting hard to breathe
C                      G
And I know you feel like dying
Am                  F
But I promise we’ll take the world to its feet
C       G        Am         F
And mooooooooooove mountains
F
Bring it to its feet
C       G        Am       N.C.
And moooooooooove mountains
 
 
[Chorus 2]
 
         C
And I’ll rise up
I'll rise like the day

I’ll rise up
I'll rise unafraid
     Am
I'll rise up
                          F

C                     G
All we need, all we need is hope
                      Am
And for that we have each other
                      F
And for that we have each other
C
We will rise

I’ll rise up
Rise like the day

I’ll rise up
In spite of the ache
Am                         F
I will rise a thousand times again
 
[Chorus 3]
           C
And we’ll rise up
High like the waves

of the chord progression and a simplified extract of the lead intro.  If you
play it like it's tabbed you'll look rather impressive, but it's really easy
to play. Enjoy! Note that all the chords are to be played as bar chords, or
even power chords (but that doesn't sound as good).

[Intro]
A
 
[Verse 1]
A
 I thought I saw you in the Battleship
D                   Bm
 but it was only a look-a-like
A
 She was nothing but a vision trick
D          Bm
 Under the warning light
        F#m     A                        F#m
She was close, close enough to be your ghost
         A
But my chances turned to toast
        D             Bm                   A   F#m   A   F#m
When I asked her if I could call her your name
 
[Verse 2]
A
I thought I saw you in the Rusty Hook
D                 Bm
 Huddled up in a wicker chair
A
 I wandered over for a closer look
D                        Bm
 And kissed whoever was sitting there
        F#m             A                  F#m
She was close, and she held me very tightly
        A                      D
'Til I asked awfully politely, please
    Bm           A    F#m   A   F#m  E
Can I call you her name
 
[Chorus]
      D                  Bm
And I elongated my lift home,
F#m                                    D
   Yeah, I let him go the long way 'round
  Bm
I smelt your scent on the seatbelt
     E
And kept my shortcuts to myself
 
[Instrumental]
A D E
 
[Verse 3]
A
 I thought I saw you in the Parrot's Beak,
D                   Bm
 Messing with the smoke alarm,
A
 It was too loud for me to hear her speak,
D                Bm
 And she had a broken arm,
       F#m    A                            F#m
It was close, so close that the walls were wet
         A                     D
And she wrote it out in letra-set
         Bm                C#m
No, you can't call me her name
 
[Bridge]
A                      C#m
 Tell me where's your hiding place
A                    C#m
 I'm worried I'll forget your face
    F#m
And I've asked everyone
    Bm                       E             E6 optional here
I'm beginning to think I imagined you all along
 
[Chorus]
      D                  Bm
And I elongated my lift home,
F#m                                    D
   Yeah, I let him go the long way 'round
  Bm
I smelt your scent on the seatbelt
    Dm
And kept my shortcuts to myself
 
[Solo]
A D Bm
A D Bm
F#m Bm
D E
 
[Verse 4]
A
 I saw your sister in the Cornerstone
D                     Bm
 On the phone to the middle man
A
 When I saw that she was on her own
D                     Bm
 I thought she might understand
        F#m              A                  F#m
She was close, well you couldn't get much closer
              A                          D
She said I'm really not supposed to but yes,
         Bm                 A
You can call me anything you want

[Verse]
 
Am                      C
Jumping up and down the floor
   C          Fmaj7
My head is an animal
    Am                    C
And once there was an animal
C                           Fmaj7
It had a son that mowed the lawn
    Am             C
The son was an ok guy
C                    Fmaj7
They had a pet dragonfly
    Am                 C
The dragonfly it ran away
C                                Fmaj7
But it came back with a story to say

Hey!
Am  C    Fmaj7

[Verse]
 
    Am                   C
Her dirty paws and furry coat
                        Fmaj7
She ran down the forest slope
    Am                  C
The forest of talking trees
                                          Fmaj7
They used to sing about the birds and the bees
    Am                  C
The bees had declared a war
                                   Fmaj7
The sky wasn't big enough for them all
    Am                         C
The birds they got help from below
                                     Fmaj7
From dirty paws and the creatures of snow

    Am                       C
And for a while things were cold
                               Fmaj7
They were scared down in their holes
    Am                   C
The forest that once was green
                                     Fmaj7
Was colored black by those killing machines
    Am                   C
But she and her furry friends
                                Fmaj7
Took down the queen bee and her men
    Am                    C
And that's how the story goes
                                             Fmaj7
The story of the beast with those four dirty paws

I think these chords are pretty close for piano.  You have the ascending bass line of
notes F# G, A Bb, C D, E F under the chords during the verses.
Bb can be played as Bbsus2 instead.
 
 
[Intro]
Gm  Bb  Dm  F
 
 
[Verse 1]
Gm           Bb
 Head under water
         Dm
And they tell me
            F
To breathe easy for a while
Gm                   Bb
 But breathing gets harder
     Dm       F
Even I know that
Gm                 Bb
 You made room for me
                     Dm
But it's too soon to see
       F
If I'm happy in your hands
Gm          Bb              Dm     F
 I'm unusually hard to hold on to
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
Gm              Am
 Blank stares at  blank pages
Bb        C
 No easy way to say this
Gm            Am                   Bb
 You mean well,  but you make this hard on me
 
 
[Chorus]
                          Gm
I'm not gonna write you a love song
           C
Cause you asked for it
           F/A           Bb
Cause you need one, you see
                          Gm
I'm not gonna write you a love song
           C
Cause you tell me it's

If you're on your way

I'm not gonna write you to stay

To write you a love song today,   today, yeah
 
 
[Verse 2]
Gm              Bb
 I learned the hard way
          Dm
That they all say
F
Things you wanna hear
Gm             Bb
 And my heavy heart
      Dm        F
Sings deep down under you
Gm               Bb
And your twisted words
               Dm
Your help just hurts
         F                        Gm
You were not what I thought you were
   Bb    Dm        F
Hello to high and dry
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
Gm           Am
 Convinced me  to please you
Bb            C
 Made me think that I need this too
Gm         Am           Bb
 I'm trying  to let you hear me as I am

To write you a love song today
 
 
[Bridge]
   Am      Bb
Promise me
                 F     C
You'll leave the light on
Dm           Am      Bb
  To help me see

With daylight, my guide, gone

You can love me because I say
 
 
[Chorus]
                     Gm
I won't write you a love song

Cause you asked for it

Cause you need one, you see

I'm not gonna write you a love song

Cause you tell me it's

Make or break in this

Is that why you wanted a love song?

I'm not gonna write you to stay
        Bb
If your heart is no where in it
        C
I don't want it for a minute
          Dm
Babe I'll walk the seven seas
         G/B
When I believe that there's a reason
   Bb          C            Gm  Bb  Dm  F
To write you a love song today,   today

Ayoko ng maulit pa

C             G               D          Em
  You were in college working part-time, waiting tables
C        G          D
  Left a small town never looked back
C         G          D       Em

  You put your arm around me for the first time

  And there's a drawer of my things at your place
C                G               D          Em
  You learned my secrets and you figure out why I'm guarded?

[Verse 1]
 
G           C  G             D7   G
Hey, where did we go, days when the rain came
         C    G           D7         G
Down in the hollow, playing a new game
           C                G
Laughing, and a running, hey, hey
          D7     G       C
Skipping and a jumping in the misty morning fog,
    G       D7           C    D7             G         Em
with our hearts a thumpin' and you,  my brown eyed girl
C    D7        G    D7
You, my brown eyed girl
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
G        C        G              D7
Whatever happened to Tuesday and so slow
G              C
Going down to the old mine
G                D7
With a transistor radio
G                      C
Standing in the sunlight laughing
G               D
Hiding behind a rainbow's wall
G               C
Slipping and a sliding
G               D7
All aling the waterfall
C           D7               G       Em
With you,       my brown eyed girl
C   D7             G
You, my brown eyed girl

Do you remember when we used to sing

Sha la la la la la la la te da  la te da
 
 
[Verse 3]
 
G        C        G              D7
So hard to find my way, now that I'm all on my own
G              C
I saw you just the other day
G                D7
My, how you have grown
G                      C
Cast my memory back there Lord
G               D
Sometimes I'm overcome thinkin' 'bout it
G               C
Making love in the green grass
G               D7
Behind the stadium
C           D7               G       Em
With you,        my brown eyed girl
C   D7             G

F#m          D
You were a child
                   A                E/G#
Crawling on your knees toward him
F#m               D
Making momma so proud
A                      E/G#        F#m   D
But your voice is too loud
                  A           E/G#
We like to watch you laughing
F#m                          D
You pick the insects off of plants

No time to think of consequences

F#m          D           A       E/G#

But it's sending me shivers
F#m           D
    A baby is born
A                  E/G#
  Crying out for attention
F#m             D
   The memories fade
                       A                E/G#
Like looking through a fogged mirror

Decision to decisions are made and not bought

But I thought this wouldn't hurt a lot, I guess not

[Verse]
 
                            E
You used to get it in your fishnets
                             C#m
Now you only get it in your night dress
                  B                  F#m
Discarded all the naughty nights for niceness
                        B
Landed in a very common crisis
                            E
Everything's in order in a black hole
                               C#m
Nothing seems as pretty as the past though
                  B              F#m
The Bloody Mary's lacking her Tabasco
                               B
Remember when you used to be a rascal?
 
 
[Chorus]
 
               F#m
Oh the boy's a slag
                     B
The best you ever had
                     F#m
The best you ever had
          B                F#m
Is just a memory and those dreams
               B
But as daft as they seem
               F#m
As daft as they seem
                  A
My love when you dream them up...
 
 
[Verse]
 
                                   E
Flicking through a little book of sex tips
                                  C#m
Remember when the boys were all electric?
           B                     F#m
Now when she's told she's gonna get it
                                     B
I'm guessing that she'd rather just forget it
                             E
Clinging to not getting sentimental
                              C#m
Said she wasn't going but she went still
               B                F#m
Likes her gentlemen not to be gentle
        s.c                           s.c.
Was it a Mecca dauber or a betting pencil?
 
 
[Chorus]
 
               F#m
Oh the boy's a slag
                  B
The best you ever had
                  F#m
The best you ever had
           B                F#m
Is just a memory and those dreams
                    B
But as daft as they seem
                F#m
As daft as they seem
                 B
My love when you dream them up
   G#m               C#m
Oh Flo, where did you go?
              F#m
Where did you go?
              G#m  F#m
Where did you go? Woah.
 
 
[Instrumental]
 
E C#m B F#m B
 
 
[Chorus]
 
E          C#m
Falling about
    F#m                        B
You took a left off Last Laugh Lane
              E             C#m
You were just sounding it out
F#m                       B
You're not coming back again.
 
E          C#m
Falling about
    F#m                        B
You took a left off Last Laugh Lane
              E             C#m
You were just sounding it out
F#m                      B
You're not coming back again.
 
 
[Outro]
 
                           E
You used to get it in your fishnets
                            C#m
Now you only get it in your night dress
                    B                 F#m
Discarded all the naughty nights for niceness
                        B
Landed in a very common crisis
                           E
Everything's in order in a black hole
                               C#m
Nothing seems as pretty as the past though
                   B           F#m
That Bloody Mary's lacking in Tabasco
                              B        C#m
Remember when he used to be a rascal?

Do you know what's worth fighting for,
Am        F        C      G
When it's not worth dying for?
Am      F        C      G
Does it take your breath away

   -the key is C#m (same notes as E major)
 
   -The guitar strums on the off beat
   when the kick drum doesn't play
 
   -There's a lot of varied chord voices but my favorite way to
   play it when you have two guitar players is to have one guitar
   player transpose down 9 half-steps and play with a capo on the
   9th fret, while the other plays the regular chords with no capo.
 
 
[Intro]
 
C#m - C#m
 
 
[Verse 1]
 
C#m                                    A
  On the other side of a street I knew Stood a girl that looked like you
E                          B
I guess that's déjà vu But I thought this can't be true
      C#m                      A
Cause you moved to west L.A or New York or Santa Fe
   E                           B
Or where ever to get away from me
 
 
[Pre-chorus]
 
F#m                   A
 Oh but that one night Was more than just right
C#m                B
 I didn't leave you cause I was all through
F#m                  A
 Oh I was overwhelmed and frankly scared as hell
G#                 G#7
 Because I really fell for you
 
 
[Chorus]
 
A                E                    B                   C#m  B
 Oh I swear to ya I'll be there for ya This is not a drive by
A              E                   B                    Cdim
 Just a shy guy looking for a 2-ply Hefty bag to hold my love
A                 E                   B                       C#m
 When you move me everything is groovy They don't like it sue me
             B     A               E
 The way you do me Oh I swear to ya I'll be there for ya
F#m                 G#7
 This is not a drive by
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
C#m                                    A
 On the other side of a downward spiral My love for you went viral
E                          B              C#m
 And I loved you every mile you drove away But now here you are again
   A
 So let's skip the ""how you been""
    E                                   B
 And get down to the ""more than friends"" at last
 
 
[Pre-chorus]
 
F#m                   A
 Oh but that one night Was still the highlight
C#m                B
 I didn't neeed you until I came to
F#m                 A
 And I was overwhelmed and frankly scared as hell
G#                 G#7
 Because I really fell for you
 
 
[Chorus]
 
A                E                    B                   C#m  B

A                 E                   B                       C#m
 When you move me everything is groovy They don't like it sue me
             B     A               E
 The way you do me Oh I swear to ya I'll be there for ya
F#m                 G#7
 This is not a drive by
 
 
[Bridge]
 
F#m7      C#m       A       B  A
Please believe that when I leave
        G#            C#m
There's nothing up my sleeve but love for
B
You And a little time to get my head together too
 
 
[Verse 3]
 
C#m                                  A
 On the other side of a street I knew Stood a girl that looked like you

    I don't have much money, but,       boy if I did
D               Em          G               A    Asus4 A Asus2
  I'd buy a big house where   we both could live
 
[Verse 2]
D            Gmaj7     A/C#                F#m
  If I was a sculptor,      but then again no
     Bm            Bmadd11/A    Bmadd11/G#       G
Or a man who makes potions in a       travelling show
     D/A               A   Asus2         F#         Bm
Oh I     know it's not much but it's the best I can do
D               Em        G              D  Dsus4 D Dsus2
  My gift is my song, and   this one for you
 
[Chorus]
A/C#                  Bm        Em               G

[Verse 3]
D              Gmaj7  A/C#                    F#m
  I sat on the roof,       and kicked off the moss
       Bm         Bmadd11/A          Bmadd11/G# Gmaj7
Well a few of the verses they've got me quite   crossed
D/A                    A    Asus2  F#                    Bm
    But the sun's been quite kind,    while I wrote this song
D                      Em       G               A   Asus4 A Asus2
  It's for people like you that  keep it turned on
 
[Verse 4]
D                 Gmaj7     A/C#           F#m
  So excuse me forgetting,       but these I do
Bm                 Bmadd11/A         Bmadd11/G#       G
   You see I've forgotten if they're green or they're blue
D/A                      A  Asus2          F#      Bm
    Anyway, the thing is,   what I reallly mean
D                Em            G           D   Dsus4 D Dsus2
   Yours are the sweetest eyes   I've ever seen

Standard tuning. Capo 1st fret.
 
 
[Verse 1]
Em                          A
   Vintage tee, brand new phone
                         G
   High heels on cobblestones
                                          A
   When you are young they assume you know nothing
Em                          A                  G
   Sequined smile, black lipstick, sensual politics
                                            A
   When you are young, they assume you know nothing
 
[Pre-Chorus]
D                                  A
   But I knew you, dancin' in your Levi's
                                G
   Drunk under a streetlight, I
                             A
   I knew you, hand under my sweatshirt
 
   Baby, kiss it better, I
 
[Chorus 1]
Em                                   A
   And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
                       G
   Under someone's bed
                                     A
   You put me on and said I was your favorite
 
[Verse 2]
Em                                 A
   A friend to all is a friend to none
                             G
   Chase two girls, lose the one
                                            A
   When you are young, they assume you know nothing
 
[Pre-Chorus]
D
   But I knew you
                    A
   Playing hide-and-seek and
                            G
   Giving me your weekends, I
 
   I knew you
                         A
   Your heartbeat on the High Line
 
   Once in twenty lifetimes, I
 
[Chorus 2]
G                                    Bm
   And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
                       D
   Under someone's bed
                                     G
   You put me on and said I was your favorite
 
[Break]
G   Bm
A   G
 
[Verse 3]
              G
   To kiss in cars, and downtown bars
              Bm
   Was all we needed
            A
   You drew stars around my scars
               G
   But now I'm bleedin'
D
   'Cause I knew you
                   A
   Steppin' on the last train
                                G
   Marked me like a bloodstain, I
 
   I knew you
                       A
   Tried to change the ending
 
   Peter losin' Wendy, I
D
   I knew you
                   A                             G
   Leavin' like a father, runnin' like water, I
                                            A
   When you are young, they assume you know nothing
 
[Bridge]
                    D
   But I knew you'd linger like a tattoo kiss
                 A
   I knew you'd haunt all of my what-ifs
                 G
   The smell of smoke would hang around this long
                 A
   'Cause I knew everything when I was young
               D
   I knew I'd curse you for the longest time
           A
   Chasin' shadows in the grocery line
                 G
   I knew you'd miss me once the thrill expired
                  A
   And you'd be standin' in my front porch light
                         Em
   And I knew you'd come back to me
                   A
   And you'd come back to me
                   G
   And you'd come back to me
                   A
   And you'd come back
 
[Chorus 3]
G                                    Bm
   And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
                       D
   Under someone's bed
                                     G
   You put me on and said I was your favorite

[Verse 1]
A                     Amaj7
I've been awake for a while now

You've got me feelin' like a child now
A                            Amaj7

I've been asleep for a while now
D                            A
You tucked me in just like a child now
A                             Amaj7
'cause every time you hold me in your arms
D                         A

Baby, just take your time now

You have gone and so effortlessly
 
You have won
                  Dsus4
You can go ahead tell them
 
 
[Chorus]
                 Em
Tell them all I know now
                   G
Shout it from the rooftops
                  D
Write it on the skyline
               C
All we had is gone now
                 Em
Tell them I was happy
                G
And my heart is broken

All my scars are open

Tell them what I hoped would be

Impossible, impossible

Impossible, impossible
 
 
[Verse 2]
Em
Falling out of love is hard
G
Falling for betrayal is worse
D
Broken trust and broken hearts
C
I know, I know
Em
Thinking all you need is there
G
Building faith on love is worst
D
Empty promises will wear
C
I know (I know)

I can think of all the times

You told me not to touch the light
  E                  B/E        A/E
I never thought that you would be the one
  E               B/E

How you even thought it could be right
      E             B/E        A/E
Cause everything we cherished is gone
 
[Pre-Chorus]

And in the end, can you tell me if
       G#m       A               A
It was worth the try, so I can decide
 
[Chorus]
E                B/E           A/E
Leaves will soon grow from the bareness of trees
    A           E          B
And all will be alright in time
     E         B/E            A/E
From waves overgrown come the calmest of seas

And all will be alright in time

Try as hard as I might
   A/E
To flee the shadows of the night
   E             B/E              A/E
It haunts me and it makes me feel blue
    E         B/E
But how can I try to hide
     A/E
When every breath and every hour
E              B/E         A/E
I still end up thinking of you

Makes it worth the fight

So I will hold on for as long

And all will be alright in time

G                  D
That I'd decide if I should leave or stay
G                   D
But in the end what makes it worth the fights
        Gm                     Am             Bb      C
That no matter what happens we try to make it right

When You're Gone
The Best Damn Thing
2007 RCA records
Submitted by: paramore_fans@yahoo.com
 
This is one the saddest song in the album, an EMO lyrics. I think this song is about
and Av is really dependent to him and she can't live life without him. When Deryck leaves
without saying goodbye like fading away and his clothes are left on the floor like it
on Verse 2. This song will sure make you cry!!!

[Verse 1]
 
  G             D/F#       Em
I always needed time on my own
                  C                       D
I never thought I'd need you there when I cry
        G              D/F#            Em
And the days feel like years when I'm alone
                      C                       D
And the bed where you lie is made up on your side
 
 
[Pre-chorus]
 
     Am                         G/B
When you walk away I count the steps that you take
       C                             D
Do you see how much I need you right now
 
 
[Chorus]
 
            C        Em           D
When you're gone the pieces of my heart are missing you
            C        Em                D
When you're gone the face I came to know is missing too
            Am               C
When you're gone the words I need to hear
   G             D/F#        C                D
to always get me through the day and make it okay
 
I miss you

[Verse 2]
 
     G               D/F#  Em
I've never felt this way before
                  C                 D
Everything that I do, reminds me of you
        G           D/F#                  Em
And the clothes you left that lie on the floor
                         C                               D
And they smell just like you, I love the things that you do
 
 
[Pre-chorus]
 
     Am                         G/B
When you walk away I count the steps that you take
       C                             D
Do you see how much I need you right now
 
 
[Chorus]
 
            C        Em           D
When you're gone the pieces of my heart are missing you
            C        Em                D
When you're gone the face I came to know is missing too
            Am               C
When you're gone the words I need to hear
   G             D/F#        C                D
to always get me through the day and make it okay
 
I miss you
 
 
[Bridge]
 
Bm                      C                  G
  We were made for each other, out here forever
          D    B7
I know we were yeahh!!!
    Em
And all I ever wanted was for you to know
C
Everything I do I give my heart and soul
A/C#
I can hardly breathe
                             D

Am
  Counting days, counting days
                         F       C
Since my love up and got lost on me
Am
  And every breath that I've been taken

Since you left feels like a waste on me
Am

That you'll come back when you can find some peace
Am
  'Cause every word that I've heard spoken

Since you left feels like a hollow street

  I've been told, I've been told to get you off my mind
Am                            G

F                                          Am   Em
  Oh my lord, oh my lord, I need you by my side

There must be something in the water

By the brighter side

My sunrise on the darkest day,
                            G
Got me feeling some kind of way,
                                 D
Make me wanna savor every moment slowly, slowly.
Em
You fit me Tailor-made Love, How you put in on?
C
Got the only key, know how to turn it on?
G
The way you nibble on my ear, the only words
           D
I wanna hear, baby, take it slow so we can last long.
 
Em                              C
Tú, tú eres el imán y yo soy el metal
                                  G
Me voy acercando y voy armando el plan
                                D
Solo con pensarlo se acelera el pulso (Oh yeah)
Em                                C
Ya, ya me está gustando más de lo normal
                               G
Todos mis sentidos van pidiendo más
                                D
Esto hay que tomarlo sin ningún apuro.
 
[Chorus]
        Em
Despacito
Em                          C
Quiero respirar tu cuello despacito

Deja que te diga cosas al oído

        Em

Quiero desnudarte a besos despacito

Firmo en las paredes de tu laberinto
                                D
Y hacer de tu cuerpo todo un manuscrito
 
(Sube sube sube, sube sube)
 
[Post-chorus]
Em
Quiero ver bailar tu pelo,

Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito

Nos vamos pegando, poquito a poquito

LYRIC GUIDE FOR NON-SPANISH SPEAKER:
 
Note: Luis Fonsi's original version translated to English
      to help non-spanish speakers feel the song's emotion.
 
 
“Despacito” or “Slowly”
 
Fonsi:
 
Sí, sabes que ya llevo un rato mirándote,
Tengo que bailar contigo hoy.
Vi que tu mirada ya estaba llamándome,
Muéstrame el camino que yo voy.
 
Yes, you know I’ve been looking at you for a while,
 
I have to dance with you today.
 
I saw that your look was already calling me,
 
show me the way and I’ll go.
 
¡Oh!
Tú, tú eres el imán y yo soy el metal.
Me voy acercando y voy armando el plan,
sólo con pensarlo se acelera el pulso.
Ya, ya me está gustando más de lo normal.
Todos mis sentidos van pidiendo más,
Esto hay que tomarlo sin ningún apuro.
 
Oh!
 
You, you’re the magnet and I’m the metal.
 
I’m getting closer and coming up with a plan,
 
just thinking about it accelerates my pulse.
 
I’m already enjoying it more than normal.
 
All of my senses are asking for more,
 
this has to be done without a hurry.
 
[Chorus]
Despacito
Quiero respirar tu cuello despacito.
Deja que te diga cosas al oído,
para que te acuerdes si no estás conmigo.
Despacito
Quiero desnudarte a besos despacito.
Firmar en las paredes de tu laberinto
y hacer de tu cuerpo todo un manuscrito
 
Quiero ver bailar tu pelo, quiero ser tu ritmo
Que le enseñes a mi boca, tus lugares favoritos.
Déjame sobrepasar tus zonas de peligro,
hasta provocar tus gritos
y que olvides tu apellido
 
[Chorus]
Slowly
 
I want to breathe your neck slowly.
 
Let me whisper things in your ear,
 
that you’ll remember when you’re not with me.
 
Slowly
 
I want to undress you with kisses slowly.
 
Sign the walls of your labyrinth
 
and turn your body into a manuscript.
 
 
I want to see your hair dance, I want to be your rhythm
 
I want you to show my mouth your favorite places.
 
Let me surpass your danger zone,
 
until it makes you scream
 
and makes you forget your last name.
 
 
Daddy Yankee:
 
Si te pido un beso, ven, dámelo. Yo sé que estás pensándolo.
Llevo tiempo intentándolo, mami, esto es dando y dándolo.
Sabes que tu corazón conmigo te hace bam-bam.
Sabes que esa beba está buscando de mi bam-bam.
Ven, prueba de mi boca para ver cómo te sabe.
Quiero, quiero, quiero ver cuánto amor a ti te cabe.
Yo no tengo prisa, yo me quiero dar el viaje.
Empezamos lento, después salvaje.
 
Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito.
Nos vamos pegando, poquito a poquito.
Cuando tú me besas con esa destreza
veo que eres malicia con delicadeza.
Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito.
Nos vamos pegando, poquito a poquito.
Y es que esa belleza es un rompecabezas,
pero pa’ montarlo aquí tengo la pieza.
¡Oye!
 
If I ask you for a kiss, come on, give it to me. I know you’re thinking about it.
 
I’ve spent a while trying, mami, this is give and giving.
 
You know your heart with me goes bam-bam.
 
You know what this babe wants from me is bam-bam.
 
Come, taste my mouth to see how it tastes to you.
 
I want, want, want to see how much love fits in you.
 
I’m in no rush, I want to take the ride.
 
We’ll start slow and then go wild.
 
 
Step by step, gentle gently.
 
We’ll get closer, little by little.
When you kiss me with that skill,
 
I see that you are malice with finesse.
 
Step by step, gentle gently.
 
We’ll get closer, little by little.
This beauty is a puzzle,
 
but to put it together I have the piece.
Oye!
 
[CHORUS, 2x]
 
Luis Fonsi:
Despacito
Vamo’ a hacerlo en una playa en Puerto Rico,
hasta que las olas griten “¡Ay, Bendito!”
para que mi sello se quede contigo.
¡Bailalo!
 
Slowly
 
We’re going to do it on a beach in Puerto Rico,
 
until the waves scream “Oh, Lord!”
 
so that my seal [likely meaning mark or impression] stays with you.
 
Dance!

[Verse 1]
G                   D
Feet don't fail me now
G                     D
Take me to the finish line
                 C                        Em
All my heart, it breaks every step that I take
                         D
But I'm hoping that the gates,
 
They'll tell me that you're mine
G                         D
Walking through the city streets
G                      D
Is it by mistake or design'
            C               Em
I feel so alone on a Friday night
                           D
Can you make it feel like home, if I tell you you're mine
 
It's like I told you honey
 
 
[Chorus]
C             Em                  D
Don't make me sad, don't make me cry
                        Cmaj7
Sometimes love is not enough when the road gets tough
              C
I don't know why
                Em
Keep making me laugh,
              D
Let's go get high
                    Cmaj7
Road's long, we carry on
                            C
Try to have fun in the meantime
 
                                             Em
Come and take a walk on the wild side
                                      D
Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain
                      Cmaj7
You like your girls insane
C                  Em
Choose your last words
                  D
This is the last time
              C
Cause you and I, we were born to die
 
 
[Verse 2]
G                   D
Lost but now I am found
G                         D
I can see but once I was blind
             C                 Em
I was so confused as a little child
                            D
Tried to take what I could get
 D
Scared that I couldn't find
 
All the answers, honey
 
 
[Chorus]
C             Em                  D
Don't make me sad, don't make me cry

Sometimes love is not enough when the road gets tough
              C

Am               C              F
Gold teeth and a curse for this town
C              G
Were all in my mouth

Only I don't know how they got out, dear
Am             C      F
Turn me back into the pet
  C           G
I was when we met
      C       F            Am   G
I was happier then with no mind set
 
[Chorus]

 F     C            G
A gull takes to the wind

Well, I'd jumped from my trees
     F       C               F           C
And I'd have danced like the king of the eyesores

New slang when you notice the stripes
    C            G
The dirt in your fries

Old and bo...ny
Am                 C                F
Dawn breaks like a bull through the hall
C               G
Never should've called

But my head's to the wall

Yes I do, I believe
                             E
That one day I will be, where I was

Right there, right next to you 
 
And it's hard, the days just seem so dark

The moon, the stars, are nothing without you

Your touch, your skin, where do I begin?

No words can explain, the way I’m missing you

The night, this emptiness, this hole that I’m inside

[Verse 1]
Dmaj7     E
I had a dream
C#m                 Dmaj7
I got everything I wanted
Dmaj7            E
Not what you'd think
C#m               Dmaj7
And if I'm being honest
                       Dmaj7    E
It might have been a nightmare
               C#m       Dmaj7
To anyone who might care
Dmaj7            E
Thought I could fly
C#m                   Dmaj7
So I stepped off the Golden
Dmaj7    E
Nobody cried
 C#m         Dmaj7
Nobody even noticed
                    Dmaj7        E
I saw them standing right there
                    C#m        Dmaj7
Kinda thought they might care
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
Dmaj7     E
I had a dream
C#m                 Dmaj7
I got everything I wanted
    Dmaj7          E
But when I wake up I see
C#m      Dmaj7
You with me
        Dmaj7
And you say
 
 
[Chorus]
            E
As long as I'm here
C#m        Dmaj7
No one can hurt you
Dmaj7        E
Don't wanna lie here
C#m          Dmaj7
But you can learn to
Dmaj7        E
If I could change
    C#7          Dmaj7
The way that you see yourself
Dmaj7                E
You wouldn't wonder why you hear
C#m          Dmaj7
""They don't deserve you""
 
 
[Verse 2]
Dmaj7        E
I tried to scream
C#m                   Dmaj7
But my head was under water
Dmaj7           E
They called me weak
C#m                           Dmaj7
Like I'm not just somebody's daughter
                  Dmaj7    E
Could've been a nightmare
                            C#m         Dmaj7
But it felt like they were right there
       Dmaj7                       E
And it feels like yesterday was a year ago
   C#m                  Dmaj7
But I don't wanna let anybody know
        Dmaj7                    E
Cause everybody wants something from me now
   C#m                 Dmaj7
And I don't wanna let 'em down
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
Dmaj7     E

Would I do it again

If they knew what they said

[Verse 1]
 
Cmaj7                                     Em
   He woke up from dreaming and put on his shoes
                             Cadd9
   Started making his way past two in the morning
                             A7
   He hasn't been sober for days
Cmaj7
   Leaning now into the breeze
 Dsus2
   Remembering Sunday he falls to his knees
           Em
   They had breakfast together
            Em
   But two eggs don't last
            A7
   Like the feeling of what he needs
Cmaj7
   Now this place seems familiar to him
 Dsus2
   She pulled on his hand with a devilish grin
      Em
   She led him upstairs, she led him upstairs
           A7
   Left him dying to get in
 
 
[Chorus]
 
  G                       Cadd9
   Forgive me I'm trying to find
                          A7
   My calling, I'm calling at night
 
   I don't mean to be a bother
      Cadd9
   But have you seen this girl?
  G                             Cadd9
   She's been running through my dreams
                               A7
   And it's driving me crazy it seems
                             Cadd9
   I'm gonna ask her to marry me
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
Cmaj7                                Dsus2
  Even though she doesn't believe in love
                             Em
  He's determined to call her bluff
                               A7
  Who could deny, these butterflies?
 
  They're filling his gut
Cmaj7                  Dsus2
  Waking the neighbors, unfamiliar faces
    Em
  He pleads though he tries
    Em
  But he's only denied
           A7
  Now he's dying to get inside
 
 
[Chorus]
 
G                       Cadd9
   Forgive me I'm trying to find
                          A7
   My calling, I'm calling at night
           A7
   I don't mean to be a bother

   But have you seen this girl?
  G                             Cadd9
   She's been running through my dreams

   And it's driving me crazy it seems

   I'm gonna ask her to marry me
 
 
[Bridge]
 
 Em                           Cadd9
  The neighbors said she moved away
                          G
  Funny how it rained all day
                G
  I didn't think much of it then
             D
  But it's starting to all make sense
 D         Em                  Cadd9
  Oh I can see now that all of these clouds
     G
  Are following me in my desperate endeavor
    D                                G
  To find my whoever, whoever she may be
 
 
[Bridge 2] (Juliet Simms)
 
      G                                      Cadd9
  I'm not coming back, I've done something so terrible
                                                    A7
  I'm terrified to speak, but you'd expect that from me
                     A7
  I'm mixed up, I'll be blunt, now the rain is just
Cadd9                                     G
  Washing you out of my hair and out of my mind
                G
  Keeping an eye on the world
Cadd9
  So many thousands of feet off the ground
      A7
  I'm over you now, I'm at home in the clouds
Cadd9
  Towering over your head
 
 
[Outro] (Alex Gaskarth)
 
                 Em
  I guess I'll go home now
                 Dsus2
  I guess I'll go home now
                 Em
  I guess I'll go home now
                 A7
  I guess I'll go home.

 She used to work in a diner, never saw a woman look finer

 She grew up in a small town, never put her roots down.

 Daddy kept movin so she did too.

 Somewhere on a desert highway, she rides a Harley Davidson
 
                                    C
 Her long blonde hair flyin' in the wind.
 
                   C           G
 She's been runnin half of her life.
 
                C         G
 The chrome and steel she rides,
 
                                 C                     G
 Collidin' with the very air she breathes, the air she breathes.
 
 
 intro:
 
 You know it ain't easy, you got to hold on.
 She was an unknown legend in her time.
 Now whe's dressin' two kids, lookin' for that magic kiss.
 She gets that far away look in her eyes.

F               FM7            C                   G
Can we get it together, can we still stand side by side.
 
F              FM7   C              G
Can we make it last, like a musical ride?
 
 
>From Marilyn to Madonna, I always loved  your smile,
Now we're headed for the big divorce, California style.
I found myself singin'  like a long lost friend
The same thing that makes you live can kill you in the end.
 
chorus:
 
Sometimes its distorted not clear to you.
Sometimes the beauty of love just comes ringin' through.
New glass in the window, new leaf on the tree,
new distance between us you and me.
 
chorus:
 
notes:
use G 320033 or GIII rather than a straight open G.. a straight open G.

This looks formidable, but is actually quite easy to play, and gives
a great sound. Be sure to read the notes before attempting to play.

Harvest Moon - Neil Young
 
Tabbed by Bill Brown (brownw@cs.uregina.ca) 1993.11.07
correction rcwoods@unix1.tcd.ie
 
Chords
 
Low E is tuned down to D.
 
B = beat
B = harmonic
v = strum down
^ = strum up
 
I don't know the proper name for some of these strange
chords, so I'll just tab the different parts.
 
Part 1 - intro

D---2----|---2---|-------|   left it out.
A---2----|-------|---5---|
D---2----|-------|---5---| 
   Em        A     G (variation)
 
He drags his first few fingers back across the strings on the
up strum; so if you have nails, it sounds better.
 
Strumming pattern is the same for all the chords.
 
 
Part 1 - intro X 4
 
Part 2 - harmonics      Come a little bit closer
 
Part 2 - harmonics      Hear what I have to say
 
Part 3 - X 2
 
Part 2 - harmonics      Just like children sleepin'
 
Part 2 - harmonics      We could dream this night away
 
Part 3 - X 2

      But there's a full moon risin'

      We know where the music's playin'
G                                intro (actually starts here)
      Let's go out and feel the night

      Because I'm still in love with you
stop                  (and here)

 Ears ringin' from the battle fire,

 No one wins, it's a war of man.            ( repeat like the recording)
 
 Verse 3
 Silver mane flying in the wind
 down through the planets on the run again.
 No one knows where they're running to
 but every kind is coming two by two
 Out on the delta where the hoofbeats pound
 the daddy's runnin ont the frozen ground.
 Can't smell the poison as it follows him,
 can't smell the gas and machines
 its a war of men.
 
 
>From: pchuss@megatest.com (William Pat Chuss)
war of man
 
Tune Guitar:  DADGBD (tune 1st and 6th strings down one full step)
 
INTRO CRDS (play twice)
 
C/D		|D		|Dm7		|Bb     C
 
And now the song:
 
C/D				|D			|Dm7		
				|			|
The lit-tle crea-tures run	| in from the cold,-    |  back from the nest,
 
		| Bb      C	|C/D			|D
		|		|			|
just like the 	| days of old.  | There in the safety	| of a mother's arms
 
Dm7			|Bb	C	
			|
The warmth of ages far  |away from harm again.
 
The riff at this point is on the third and second string (G and B), open
to third fret, to second string open then second and third frets, then play
the D5 to fill it in.  If you listen you'll get it.  I'm not too good at
typing this stuff in (sorry).
 
Then the next bit goes like this:
 
Dm7		|			|Bb		|Bb5  C5  A5	|Dm (x4)
		|			|		|		|
No one wins,    |it's a war of man.	|               |               |
 
Now here's my attempt at tabbing the chords.  They sound so good because of
that DADGBD tuning.  Let that Sixth string D wring out.  Neil would ;-)
 
   C/D	   	     D		     Dm7	    Bb		     C
 
| | | | | |	| | | | | |	| | | | | |	| | | | | |	| | | | | |

    Bb5		     C5		     A5		     Dm
 
| | | | | |	| | | | | |	| | | | | |	| | | | | |
x 8 8 x x x	x1010 x x x	x 7 7 x x x	0 0 01010 x (that's 2nd and 3rd
| | | | | |     | | | | | |	| | | | | |	| | | | | |  strings on 10th ft)
 
Here's the lyrics just to round things out:
 
The little creatures run in from the cold
Back to the nest just like the days of old
There in the safety of a mother's arms
The warmth of ages, far away from harm again.
 
Ears ringin' from the battle fire
The tired warrior aims a little higher
The black falcon or the little sparrow
The healing light or the flash of the barrel
 
No one wins
It's a war of man
No one wins
It's a war of man
 
Silver mane flyin' in the wind
Down through the planets on the run again
No one knows where they're runnin' to
But every kind is comin' two by two
 
Out on the delta where the hoofbeats pound
The daddy's runnin' on the frozen ground
Can't smell the poison as it follows him
Can't see the gas and machines, it's a war of man
 
No one wins
It's a war of man
No one wins
It's a war of man
 
The windows open and the little girl dreams
The sky's her playground as she mounts her steed
Across the heavens to the other side
On wings of magic does the little girl ride
 
The little creatures run in from the cold
Back to the nest just like the days of old
There in the safety of a mother's arms
The warmth of ages, far away from harm again.
 
No one wins
It's a war of man
No one wins
It's a war of man
No one wins

notes:
where it says (eg) 'F chord 2 measures' you can do a number of things-
usually on the piano, a chord is struck and held, so you may want
to do this. alternatively, play the chord arpeggio, or pinch it
in time with beat. whatever.... you decide :-)

I'm a dreamin' man, Yes that's my problem
/G                /Em                /C    /C   /
I can't tell when I'm not being real.
/G                /Em                /C    /C   /
In the meadow dusk, I park my Aerostar
/G                /Em                /C    /C   /
With a loaded gun and sweet dreams of you.
 
chorus:
     /G
I'll always be a dreamin man
/Em
I don't have to understand
/C             /D     /
I know it's alright

I see your curves and I feel your vibrations
You dress in black and white, your lost in the mall
I watch you disappear past ""Club Med Vacations""
Another sleepless night a sun that won't fall
 
chorus
 
Now the night is gone, a new day is dawning.
And our homeless dreams go back to the street.
Another time or place, another civilization
would really make this life feel so complete
 
chorus

[Verse 1]
G                  C  G              D
 Hey, where did we go days when the rain came
G             C       G        D
 Down in the hollow playing a new game
G                 C
 Laughing, and a running, hey, hey
G                D
 Skipping and a jumping
G                C
 In the misty morning fog,

 with our hearts a thumpin' and you,     my brown eyed girl

You, my brown eyed girl
 
[Verse 2]

Whatever happened to Tuesday and so slow
G                  C               G        D
Going down to the old mine with a transistor radio
G                C
Standing in the sunlight laughing
G                D
Hiding behind a rainbow's wall
G                C
Slipping and a sliding
G               D7
All along the waterfall
      C   D7               G    Em
With you,   my brown eyed girl

So hard to find my way,
G               D
  Now that I'm all on my own
G          C
I saw you just the other day,
G        D
  My how you have grown
G               C
Cast my memory back there, Lord
G           D
  Sometime I'm overcome thinking 'bout
G                    C
Making love in the green grass
G          D7           C
Behind the stadium with you
D7             G       Em
My brown eyed girl

[Verse 1]
 
     G                          C               G
On a warm summer's evenin' on a train bound for nowhere,
  C               G                C                 D
I met up with the gambler; we were both too tired to sleep.
   G                               C             G
So we took turns a starin' out the window at the darkness
     C           G        D               G
'til boredom overtook us, and he began to speak.
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
         G                             C                G
He said, ""Son, I've made a life out of readin' people's faces,
    C                  G                 C                   D
and knowin' what their cards were by the way they held their eyes.
       G                               C                 G
And if you don't mind my sayin', I can see you're out of aces.
      C             G            D             G
For a taste of your whiskey I'll give you some advice.""
 
 
[Verse 3]
 
     G                           C                  G
So I handed him my bottle and he drank down my last swallow. 
C                G             C              D
Then he bummed a cigarette and asked me for a light.
        G                                C                 G
And the night got deathly quiet, and his face lost all expression.
                 C                    G             D                G
Said, ""If you're gonna play the game, boy, ya gotta learn to play it right.
 
 
[Chorus]
 
           G                     C             G
You got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em,
C            G         C                D

          G                            C              G
You never count your money when you're sittin' at the table.
                 C          G        D                 G
There'll be time enough for countin' when the dealin's done.
 
 
[Verse 4] (transpose +1 here if you want to play it correctly)
 
G                             C             G
Ev'ry gambler knows that the secret to survivin'
   C               G              C               D
is knowin' what to throw away and knowing what to keep.
       G                         C              G
'Cause ev'ry hand's a winner and ev'ry hand's a loser,
        C                 G              D           G
and the best that you can hope for is to die in your sleep.""

    G                               C                       G
And when he'd finished speakin', he turned back towards the window,
C               G             C            D
crushed out his cigarette and faded off to sleep.
    G                             C                 G
And somewhere in the darkness the gambler, he broke even.
    C            G                D                G
But in his final words I found an ace that I could keep.

[Verse 1]
 
G                       C                 G
Long as I remember, the rain been comin' down
G                            C               G
Clouds of mystery pourin' confusion on the ground
 
C                    G
Good men through the ages
C                  G
Tryin' to find the sun
C             D
And I wonder, still I wonder
Em               G
Who'll stop the rain
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
G                             C                  G
I went down Virginia, seeking shelter from the storm
G                 Bm      C                   G
Caught up in the fable, I watched the tower grow
 
C                   G
Five-year plans and new deals
C                 G
Wrapped in golden chains
C             D
And I wonder, still I wonder
Em               G
Who'll stop the rain

G                          C                   G
Heard the singers playin', how we cheered for more
    G                   Bm     C               G
The crowd had rushed together, tryin' to keep warm
 
C                   G
Still the rain kept pourin'
C             G
Fallin' on my ears
C             D
And I wonder, still I wonder

Who'll stop the rain...

[Verse 1]
 
G                       D
She sits alone by a lamppost
C                                           G
Trying to find a thought that's escaped her mind
G                               D
She says ""Dad's the one I love the most,
C                   G
But Stipe's not far behind!""
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
G                      D
  She never lets me in - only tells me where she's been
C                            G
  When she's had too much to drink
G                                 D
  I say that I don't care, I just run my hands through her dyed hair, and then I
C                                      G
  Pray to God, ""You gotta help me fly away"", (and just)
 
 
[Chorus]
 
        C              G
Let her cry     if the tears fall down like rain
        C             Em    G       D
Let her sing    If it eases all her pain
        C               G
Let her go      let her walk right out on me
           D
And if the sun comes up tomorrow,
        C             G
Let her be,   let her be

G    D    C    G
 
 
[Verse 3]
 
G                              D
  This morning I woke up alone, found a note standing by the phone
C                             G
  Saying ""Baby, maybe I'll be back someday.""
G                                      D
  I wanted to look for you; you walked in, I didn't know just what I should do, so I
C                                    G
  Sat back down, had a beer and felt sorry for myself
 
 
[Chorus]
 
        C              G
Let her cry     if the tears fall down like rain
        C             Em    G       D
Let her sing    if it eases all her pain

Let her go      let her walk right out on me

[Verse 4]
G                             D
  Last night I tried to leave, cried so much I could not believe
C                                          G
  She was the same girl I fell in love with long ago
G                                  D
  She went in the back to get high; I sat down on my couch and cried, yelling
C                       G
  ""Oh Mama! Please help me.  Won't you hold my hand?""
 
 
[Chorus]

Let her cry     if the tears fall down like rain

Let her sing    if it eases all her pain
        C               G
Let her go      let her walk right out on me
           D                              G
And if the sun comes up tomorrow, let her be
 
        C              G
Let her cry     if the tears fall down like rain
        C             Em    G       D
Let her sing    if it eases all her pain
        C               G
Let her go      let her walk right out on me

And if the sun comes up tomorrow,

Let her be,  oh let her be
 
 
 
 
Performance Notes:
        1. tambourine
              onehit on the 2-beat starts at line 3 and continues during
              the verses
              double-time accent 3 during chorus and solo
 
        2. drums:
             ride shimmer  between line 4 and 5
             enter at first chorus
             don't play during last verse (shimmer accents only)

        3. vocal harmonies
             first chorus on ""if the sun comes up tomorrow""

             ""if the sun comes up tomorrow""
 
        4. lead guitar
             arpeggiates chords during chorus

             classic Marshall/Les Paul sound
 
        5. all
             in the chorus after the solo and the last chorus, the last
             two lines are played with reduced dynamics - no drums,

[Verse]
        Em
Imagine me and you, I do

I think about you day and night, it’s only right

[Verse]
        Gm
I have often told you stories
F
About the way
   Gm
I lived the life of a drifter
Dm
  waiting for the day
          Gm
When I'd take your hand and sing you songs
      F
Then maybe you would say
Gm
Come lay with me and love me
Dm
  And I would surely stay
 
[Chorus]

Of a windmill going round

I looked for something new

In days of old when nights were cold
Dm
   I wandered without you
Gm
But those days I thought my eyes
F
Had seen you standing near
Gm
Though blindness is confusing
Dm
It shows that you're not here.

[Verse]
Fmaj7                    Am         Cadd4            C
She'll lie and steal and cheat, and beg you from her knees
    Fmaj7               Am    G       C
And make you thinks she means it this time
Fmaj7                 Am       Cadd4           C
She'll tear a hole in you, the one you can't repair
    Fmaj7             Am      G      C
But I still love her, I don't really care
 
 
[Bridge]
Fmaj7        C      Am     G
When we were young, Oh Oh, we did enough
Fmaj7       C      Am      G
When it got cold, Ooh Ooh, we bundled up
Fmaj7     C     Am    G                C
I cant be told, Ah Ah It cant be done
 
 
[Verse]
Fmaj7             Am           Cadd4      C
It's better to feel pain, than nothing at all
    Fmaj7       Am       G    C
The opposite of love's indifference
Fmaj7         Am       Cadd4            Am    G         C
Pay attention now, I'm standing on your porch screaming out
    Fmaj7          Am      G        C
And I wont leave until you come downstairs
 
 
[Chorus]
Fmaj7             C/G           G    Am
So keep your head up, keep your love
Fmaj7          C/G    G    Am

Fmaj7          C/G    G    Am

[Verse]
Fmaj7            Am       Cadd4             Am   G         C
I don't blame ya dear for running like you did, all these years
    Fmaj7      Am         G       C
I would do the same, your best believe
Fmaj7                       Am         Cadd4              Am     G  C
The highway signs say we're close, but I don't read those things anymore
  Fmaj7         Am G   C
I never trusted my own eyes
 
 
[Bridge]
Fmaj7        C     Am     G
When we were young oh oh, we did enough
Fmaj7        C     Am     G
When it got cold, Ooh ooh we bundled up
Fmaj7      C     Am    G                  C
I can't be told, Ah ah, can't be done
 
 
[Chorus]
Fmaj7             C/G           G    Am
So keep your head up, keep your love
Fmaj7          C/G    G    Am
keep your head up, my love
Fmaj7          C/G    G    Am
keep your head up, my love
Fmaj7          C/G           G    Am
Keep your head up, keep your love
Fmaj7 C/G   G    Am
Head  up,   love

Head  up,   love

Em                      D
 I was listening to the ocean
Em                  D
I saw a face in the sand
           C
But when I picked it up
         G         D          C
Then it vanished away from my hands
Em                  D
I had a dream I was seven
Em                   D
Climbing my way in a tree
        C
I saw a piece of heaven
G          D          C
Waiting impatient for me

And I was running far away
      C
Would I run off the world someday?
G                D
Nobody knows, nobody knows
   Am
And I was dancing in the rain
   C
I felt alive and I can't complain
 
 
[Chorus]
 
G
But now take me home
D                   Cmaj7
Take me home where I belong

Em               D
I was painting a picture
Em                            D
The picture was a painting of you and
      C                         G
For a moment I thought you were here
           D              C
But then again, it wasn't true
    Em                        D
And all this time I have been lying
    Em                    D
Oh, lying in secret to myself
        C                       G            D
I've been putting sorrow on the farrest place
        C
On my shelf, da di da
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
 
    Am
And I was running far away
      C
Would I run off the world someday?
G                D
Nobody knows, nobody knows
   Am
And I was dancing in the rain

But I kept running

For a soft place to fall

And I kept running

For a soft place to fall
          Am
And I kept running

For a soft place to fall

capo there is another version on this website that also sounds pretty good that doesn't
require a capo.

Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer

Had a very shiny nose

And if you ever saw it

You would even say it glows
G
All of the other reindeer
                           D
Used to laugh and call him names
D
They never let poor Rudolph
                     G
Join in any reindeer games

Rudolph with your nose so bright
A7                 D7
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight

Then how the reindeer loved him

Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer

   Steal some covers share some skin
Dm7           G7               C
   Clouds are shrouding us in moments unforgettable
    Dm7               G7             C
You twist to fit the mold that I am in
     Dm7               G7           C
But things just get so crazy living life gets hard to do
            Dm7            G7              C
And I would gladly hit the road get up and go if I knew
     Dm7               G7             C
That someday it would lead me back to you

That may be all I  need

In darkness she is all I  see
                   Dm7    G7  C
Come and rest your bones with me
                       Dm7
Driving slow on Sunday morning
       G7            C
And I never want to leave

   Paint a picture with my hands, oh oh
Dm7             G7                 C
   And back and forth we sway like branches in a storm
           Dm7               G7             C
Change the weather still together when it ends
 
 
[Chorus]
 
            Dm7 G7 C
That may be all I  need
                   Dm7 G7 C
In darkness she is all I  see
                   Dm7    G7  C
Come and rest your bones with me
                       Dm7
Driving slow on Sunday morning
      G7            C
And I never want to leave

[Verse 1]
   G       D       G        A
In Christ alone my hope is found,
D/F#      G           A          D
He is my light, my strength, my song;
     G     D           G       A
This Cornerstone, this solid Ground,
D/F#               G        A          D
Firm through the fiercest drought and storm.
     D/F#        G         D/F#       A
What heights of love, what depths of peace,
     D/F#       G             D/F#      A
When fears are stilled, when strivings cease!
   G     D       G      A
My Comforter, my All in All,
D/F#         G        A        D
Here in the love of Christ I stand.
 
[Verse 2]
   G       D          G       A
In Christ alone! Who took on flesh
D/F#        G     A        D
Fullness of God in helpless babe!
     G        D        G       A
This gift of love and righteousness
D/F#           G        A       D
Scorned by the ones he came to save:
     D/F#     G       D/F#   A
Till on that cross as Jesus died,
    D/F#      G      D/F#  A
The wrath of God was satisfied
    G     D      G        A
For every sin on Him was laid;
D/F#        G          A       D
Here in the death of Christ I live.
 
[Verse 3]
      G        D        G     A
There in the ground His body lay
D/F#         G          A        D
Light of the world by darkness slain:
      G        D        G        A
Then bursting forth in glorious Day
D/F#        G         A     D
Up from the grave he rose again!
    D/F#   G       D/F#   A
And as He stands in victory
      D/F#       G       D/F#     A
Sin's curse has lost its grip on me,
    G     D      G      A
For I am His and He is mine
D/F#             G        A         D
Bought with the precious blood of Christ.
 
[Verse 4]
   G         D        G        A
No guilt in life, no fear in death,
D/F#         G         A       D
This is the power of Christ in me;
     G             D      G      A
From life's first cry to final breath.
D/F#   G           A    D
Jesus commands my destiny.
   D/F#      G       D/F#       A
No power of hell, no scheme of man,
    D/F#   G       D/F#     A
Can ever pluck me from His hand;
     G      D       G        A
Till He returns or calls me home,
D/F#         G         A          D
Here in the power of Christ I'll stand.

I've never known the loving of a man
       A                         D6add9/A
but it sure felt nice when he was holding my hand

               G
A penny for my thoughts
        D
Oh no, I'll sell them for a dollar
  A                         D6add9/A

And maybe then you'll hear the words I've been singing
A                          D6add9/A
Funny when you're dead how people start listening

It's a god-awful small affair
           D7
To the girl with the mousy hair
Gm         Bb                                 C7
   But her mummy is yelling ""No""

And her daddy has told her to go

Now she walks through her sunken dream.
Gm         Bb                                 C7
To the seat with the clearest view

There's battle lines bein' drawn.
         E                    A
Nobody's right if everybody's wrong.
E                           A
Young people speakin' their minds

A thousand people in the street

G                         Em
  I've been living with a shadow overhead
G                           Em
  I've been sleeping with a cloud above my bed
Am                       D
  I've been lonely for so long
Am                            D
Trapped in the past, I just can't seem to move on
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
G                         Em
  I've been hiding all my hopes and dreams away
G                     Em
  Just in case I ever need em again someday
Am                   D
  I've been setting aside time
   Am                           D
To clear a little space in the corners of my mind
 
 
[Chorus]
 
G               Em            C              G
  All I want to do is find a way back into love
G                 Em                 C              G
  I can't make it through without a way back into love
      D
Oh oh oh
 
 
[Verse 3]
 
G                            Em
  I've been watching but the stars refuse to shine
G                           Em
  I've been searching but I just don't see the signs
Am                 D
  I know that it's out there 
        Am                        D
There's got to be something for my soul somewhere
 
 
[Verse 4]
 
G                           Em
  I've been looking for someone to shed some light
G                      Em
  Not somebody just to get me through the night 
Am                    D
  I could use some direction
Am                    D
  And I'm open to your suggestions
 
 
[Chorus]
 
G               Em            C              G

  I can't make it through without a way back into love
         Am
And if I open my heart again
            C                      D
I guess I'm hoping you'll be there for me in the end

  There are moments when I don't know if it's real
G               Em
  Or if anybody feels the way I feel
Am            D
  I need inspiration
Am                    D
  Not just another negotiation

And if I open my heart to you

I'm hoping you'll show me what to do
           Am
And if you help me to start again
    D                                          G
You know that I'll be there for you in the end

Misunderstanding all you see

D                                      G
And do you think I'm wasting my time doing things I wanna do?
D                                     G
But it hurts when you disapprove all along
Em
And now I try hard to make it
G                       D
I just want to make you proud
D                                  Em
I'm never gonna be good enough for you
                            G
I can't pretend that I'm alright
A
And you can't change me
 
 
[Chorus]
 
        D
'Cuz we lost it all
        A
Nothing lasts forever
     Bm
I'm sorry
  A/B      G
I can't be perfect
         D
Now it's just too late
       A
And we can't go back
     Bm
I'm sorry
  A/B      G
I can't be perfect
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
D
I try not to think
G
About the pain I feel inside
D                               G
Did you know you used to be my hero?
D                              G
All the days you spent with me now seem so far away
D                                  G
And it feels like you don't care anymore
Em
And now I try hard to make it
G                        D
I just want to make you proud
D                                  Em
I'm never gonna be good enough for you
                        G
I can't stand another fight
A
And nothing's alright
 
 
[Chorus]
 
        D
'Cuz we lost it all
        A
Nothing lasts forever
     Bm
I'm sorry
  A/B      G
I can't be perfect
         D
Now it's just too late
       A
And we can't go back
     Bm
I'm sorry
  A/B      G
I can't be perfect
 
 
[Bridge]
 
G                            A               D
Nothing's gonna change the things that you said
G                        A       D
Nothing's gonna make this right again
Bm
Please don't turn your back
   A
I can't believe it's hard
G
Just to talk to you
 
But you don't understand
 
 
[Chorus]
 
        D
'Cuz we lost it all
        A
Nothing lasts forever
     Bm
I'm sorry
           G
I can't be perfect
         D
Now it's just too late
       A
And we can't go back
     Bm
I'm sorry
           G
I can't be perfect
 
        D
'Cuz we lost it all
        A
Nothing lasts forever
     Bm
I'm sorry
           G
I can't be perfect
         D
Now it's just too late
       A
And we can't go back
     Bm
I'm sorry
           G
I can't be perfect

[Verse 1]
            D
Well, I was there on the day
 
They sold the cause for the queen,
             Bm
And when the lights all went out
 
We watched our lives on the screen.
           G
I hate the ending myself,
                                A
But it started with an alright scene.
 
           D
It was the roar of the crowd
 
That gave me heartache to sing.
         Bm
It was a lie when they smiled
 
And said, ""you won't feel a thing"".
          G
And as we ran from the cops
                             A
We laughed so hard it would sting
           F#/A#
Yeah yeah, oh.
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
Bm        Em
If I'm so wrong (so wrong, so wrong)
A                            D             A          Bm
How can you listen all night long? (night long, night long)
                   G
Now will it matter after I'm gone?
            A
Because you never learn a goddamn thing.
 
 
[Chorus]
A7            D
You're just a sad song with nothing to say
        Bm
About a life long wait for a hospital stay.
           Em
And if you think that I'm wrong,
                         A
This never meant nothing to ya.
 
 
[Verse 2]
           D
I spent my high school career
 
Spit on and shoved to agree
           Bm
So I could watch all my heroes
 
Sell a car on TV.
              G
Bring out the old guillotine
                            A
We'll show 'em what we all mean.
           F#/A#
Yeah yeah, oh.

[Bridge]
   D       Bb        D        Bb
So go, go away, just go, run away.
                   D          D/C#           Bm
But where did you run to? And where did you hide?
          A     G              A
Go find another way, price you pay.

[Verse 1]
         C                 Am
Now I've heard there was a secret chord
     C                    Am
That David played, and it pleased the Lord
    F                G               C       G
But you don't really care for music, do you?
   C                   F           G
It goes like this, the fourth, the fifth
    Am              F
The minor fall, the major lift
    G               E            Am
The baffled king composing, hallelujah
 
 
[Chorus]
     F           Am          F           C  G C   G
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelu - jah
 
[Verse 2]
     C                         Am
Your faith was strong, but you needed proof
    C               Am
You saw her bathing on the roof
    F              G             C        G
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew ya
    C             F       G
She tied you to a kitchen chair
    Am                         F
She broke your throne, and she cut your hair
    G                  E             Am
And from your lips she drew the hallelujah
 
 
[Chorus]
     F           Am          F           C  G C   G
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelu - jah
 
[Verse 3]
C               Am
Baby, I've been here before
  C                    Am
I know this room, I've walked this floor
  F             G             C        G
I used to live alone before I knew you
     C                     F      G
I've seen your flag on the marble arch
Am            F
Love is not a victory march
       G                E           Am
It's a cold, and it's a broken hallelujah
 
 
[Chorus]
     F           Am          F           C  G C   G
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelu - jah
 
 
[Verse 4]
      C                   Am
There was a time when you let me know
       C            Am
What's really going on below
    F             G              C       G
But now you never show it to me, do you?
      C             F        G
And remember when I moved in you
    Am            F
The holy dove was moving too
    G               E             Am
And every breath we drew was hallelujah
 
 
[Chorus]
     F           Am          F           C  G C   G
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelu - jah
 
 
[Verse 5]
C               Am
Maybe there's a God above
    C          Am
And all I ever learned from love
    F               G              C        G
Was how to shoot at someone who outdrew you
     C                 F       G
It's not a cry you can hear at night
     Am                   F
It's not somebody who has seen the light
       G                E           Am
It's a cold, and it's a broken hallelujah

Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelu - jah
 
 
[Verse 6]
    C              Am
You say I took the name in vain
       C            Am
Though I don't even know the name
    F              G                 C      G
But if I did, well really, what's it to ya?
          C                 F     G
There's a blaze of light in every word
   Am             F
It doesn't matter which you heard
    G           E           Am
The holy or the broken hallelujah
 
 
[Chorus]
     F           Am          F           C  G C   G
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelu - jah
 
 
[Verse 7]
  C               Am
I did my best, it wasn't much
  C                   Am
I couldn't feel, so I tried to touch
     F                 G              C       G
I've told the truth, I didn't come to fool ya
    C              F        G
And even though it all went wrong
     Am               F
I'll stand before the Lord of Song

[Intro]
C Csus4 C Csus2
 
[Verse 1]
C                                      Em
I thought I saw a man brought to life
                                         F
He was warm, he came around like he was dignified
                 F
He showed me what it was to cry
C                                       Em
Well you couldn't be that man I adored
                  Em
You don't seem to know
                             F
Don't seem to care what your heart is for
            F
But I don't know him anymore
 
[Pre-Chorus 1]
        Am
There's nothing where he used to lie
G
  My conversation has run dry
Em
  That's what's going on
G
  Nothing's fine
     C
I'm torn
 
[Chorus 1]
(C)                  G                Am
I'm all out of faith, this is how I feel
                  F                           C
I'm cold and I am shamed, lying naked on the floor
               G                        Am
Illusion never changed, into something real
                   F                              C
I'm wide awake and I can see, the perfect sky is torn
                 G                  Am  (G)  F
You're a little late, I'm already torn
 
[Verse 2]
C                                    Em
So I guess the fortune teller's right
                                                    F
I should have seen just what was there and not some holy light
             F
But you crawl beneath my veins and now
 
[Pre-Chorus 2]
Am
I don't care, I have no luck
G
  I don't miss it all that much
Em
  There's just so many things
G
  That I can't touch
     C
I'm torn
 
[Chorus 2]
(C)                 G                 Am
I'm all out of faith, this is how I feel
                  F                           C
I'm cold and I am shamed, lying naked on the floor
               G                        Am
Illusion never changed, into something real
                  F                              C
I'm wide awake and I can see, the perfect sky is torn
                 G                  Am  (G)  F
You're a little late, I'm already torn

Torn...             Ooooh...  Hoo ooooh...  Ooooh
 
[Pre-Chorus 3]
Am
There's nothing where he used to lie
G
  My inspiration has run dry
Em
  That's what's going on

  Nothing's right
     C
I'm torn
 
[Chorus 3]
(C)                 G                Am
I'm all out of faith, this is how I feel

I'm cold and I am shamed, lying naked on the floor
                  G                     Am
Illusion never changed, into something real

                  F                              C
I'm cold and I am shamed, bound and broken on the floor
                 G                  Am  (G)  F
You're a little late, I'm already torn

    C                 D

When I'm high, I don't come down

[Verse 2]
C               D
You do shit on purpose
        Bm
You get mad and you break things
     C
Feel bad, try to fix things
           C
But you're perfect
             D
Poorly wired circuit

   Masasayang mga araw na kasama kita

   Punong puno ng ligaya ang ating pagsasama

C#m                    B            A              B

You'd be on your way to better things

Tempered furs and spangled boots
                  C                Am

FM7 is x00560, and you repeatedly hammer-on the third (G) string (0h5).
The mention of Dsus4 is to indicate that you should fiddle around with the
high E string, between D, Dsus4 and Dsus2.

C Em C G  C Em D G x2
 
 
[Verse 1]
 
C                        Em
She'll lie and steal and cheat
    C                 G
And beg you from her knees;
C                  Em    D       G
Make you think she means it this time.
C                     Em
She'll tear a hole in you,
C                   G
The one you can't repair,
C                    Em      D       G
But I still love her I don't really care.
 
 
[Pre-chorus]
 
C            G      Em   D
When we were young, oooh we did enough.
C           G     Em       D
When it got cold, oooooooo we bundled up.
C          G     Em        D                G
I can't be told, aaaaaaaah it can't be done.
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
C                       Em
It's better to feel pain
    C                 G
Than nothing at all;
C                  Em    D       G
The opposite of love's indifference.
C                     Em
So pay attention now,
C                   G
I'm standing on your porch screamin' out,
C                    Em      D       G
And I won't leave until you come downstairs.
 
 
[Chorus]
 
             C    G             D  Em
So keep your head up, keep your love.
 C    G             D  Em
Keep your head up, my love.
          C    G    D  Em
Keep your head up, love.
 C    G             D  Em
Keep your head up, keep your love.
 
 
[Verse 3]
 
C                        Em
I don't blame you dear,
    C                 G
Running like you did all these years,
C                  Em    D       G
I would do the same you best believe.
C                     Em
And the highway signs say we're close,
C                   G
But I don't read those things anymore;
C                    Em      D       G
I never trusted my own eyes.
 
 
[Pre-chorus]
 
C            G      Em   D
When we were young, oooh we did enough.
C           G     Em       D
When it got cold, oooooooo we bundled up.
C          G     Em        D                G
I can't be told, aaaaaaaah it can't be done.
 
 
[Chorus]
 
             C    G             D  Em
So keep your head up, keep your love.
 C    G             D  Em
Keep your head up, my love.
          C    G             D  Em
Keep your head up, love.
 C    G             D  Em
Keep your head up, keep your love.
C        G
Head up, love

Head up, love

Head up, love

Head up, love

Now the pictures that

Some that made us laugh

One that made you

Have to say goodbye
 
[Verse 4]

What I'd give to run my fingers
Throught your hair

  Touch your lips
To hold you near

When you say your prayers
Try to understand

I did this off the electric album version, the chords might not sound as right when
played with the acoustic demo.  This was done entirely by ear and looks a lot more
difficult than it is.  Just anchor your index and ring fingers onto the 2nd fret of
the G string and the 3rd fret of the B string, respectively, and use your pinky and
middle fingers to hit the bass notes.  (Or thumb for Dadd9/F#.)
 
Chords:
Dsus2/A   x00230
Dsus2/C#  x4x230
Dsus2/G   3x0230
Asus4     x02230
Dsus2/B   x20230
Dadd9/F#  2x0230
Em7       022030
 
 
[Verse 1]
 
Dsus2/A   Dsus2/G               Dsus2/C#                                 Dsus2/G
Today is a winding road that's taking me to places that I didn't want to go
     Asus4
Whoa (whoa, whoa, whoa)
Dsus2/A   Dsus2/G               Dsus2/C#                                   Dsus2/G
Today in the blink of an eye I'm holding on to something and I do not know why
 Asus4
I tried
 
 
[Pre-Chorus 1]
 
           Dsus2/B
I tried to read between the lines
           Asus4
I tried to look in your eyes
          Dadd9/F#
I want a simple explanation
               Dsus2/A
For what I'm feeling inside
               Dsus2/G
I gotta find a way out
               Asus4
Maybe there's a way out
 
 
[Chorus]
 
Dsus2/A                  Asus4
     Your voice was the soundtrack of my summer
                   Dsus2/G
Do you know you're unlike any other?
         Dsus2/B     Asus4
You'll always be my thunder, and I said
Dsus2/A                 Asus4
    Your eyes are the brightest of all the colors
             Dsus2/G
I don't wanna ever love another
       Dsus2/B       Asus4
You'll always be my thunder
   Dsus2/G       Asus4
So bring on the rain
                     Dsus2/A
And bring on the thunder
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
Dsus2/A   Dsus2/G               Dsus2/C#                                     Dsus2/G
Today is a winding road tell me where to start and tell me something I don't know
     Asus4
Whoa (whoa, whoa, whoa)
Dsus2/A   Dsus2/G               Dsus2/C#                          Dsus2/G
Today I'm on my own I can't move a muscle and I can't pick up the phone
 Asus4
I don't know (I don't know, I don't know, I don't know)
 
 
[Pre-Chorus 2]
 
           Dsus2/B
And now I'm itching for the tall grass
           Asus4
And longing for the breeze
          Dadd9/F#
I need to step outside
               Dsus2/A
Just to see if I can breathe
               Dsus2/G
I gotta find a way out
                Asus4
Maybe there's a way out

[Bridge]
 
         Em7
Yeah, I'm walking on a tightrope
              Dsus2/B
I'm wrapped up in vines
    Asus4
I think we'll make it out
                     Dsus2/G
But you just gotta give me time
Dsus2/A
Strike me down with lightning
         Dsus2/B
Let me feel you in my veins
   Asus4                                        Dsus2/G

[Intro]
| G     | G     | Em7   | Em7   | Cadd9 |
 
[Verse]
G
I still remember the look on your face
Em7
Lit through the darkness at 1:58
    Cadd9
The words that you whispered for just us to know
    D
You told me you loved me so why did you go 
G
  Away?
Em7        Cadd9
  Away.
 
[Verse]
G
I do recall now the smell of the rain,
Em7
fresh on the pavement. I ran off the plane.
Cadd9
That July 9th. The beat of your heart,
   D
it jumps through your shirt. I can still feel your arms.
 
[Chorus]
        Cadd9
But now I'll go sit on the floor
        G
Wearing your clothes
                     Cadd9
All that I know is I don't know
                        D
How to be something you miss
                            G
I never thought we'd have a last kiss
                    Em7
Never imagined we'd end like this
Cadd9                           D
Your name forever the name on my lips
 
[Verse]
G
I do remember the swing in your step
    Em7
The life of the party, you're showing off again
    Cadd9
And I roll my eyes and then you pull me in
    D
I'm not much for dancin', but for you I did
        G
Because I love your handshake, meetin' my father
  Em7
I love how you walk with your hands in your pockets
        Cadd9
How you kissed me when I was in the middle of sayin' something
        D
There's not a day I don't miss those rude interruptions
 
[Chorus]
    Cadd9
And I'll go sit on the floor
        G
Wearing your clothes
                     Cadd9
All that I know is I don't know
                        D
How to be something you miss

Never imagined we'd end like this

Your name forever the name on my lips
      Cadd9 D
Oo-oo-ooh.
 
[Bridge]
G         Em7                Cadd9
  So I'll watch your life in pictures
       D                 G
Like I used to watch you sleep
         Em7         Cadd9
And I'll feel you forget me
       D                G
Like I used to feel you breathe
         Em7              Cadd9
And I'll keep up with our old friends
        D                 Cadd9
Just to ask them how you are
                         D
Hope it's nice where you are
      Cadd9
And I hope the sun shines and it's a beautiful day
    G
And something reminds you, you wish you had stayed
        Cadd9
You can plan for a change in the weather and time
    D
but I never planned on you changing your mind
 
[Chorus]
   Cadd9
So I'll go sit on the floor
        G
Wearing your clothes
                     Cadd9
All that I know is I don't know

Never imagined we'd end like this
Cadd9                           D
Your name forever the name on my lips
 
[Outro]

Just like our last kiss

Forever the name on my lips

[Verse 1]
     F         G          Am7
So I heard you found somebody else
       F         G              Am7
and at first I thought it was a lie
                  F               G
I took all of my things that make sounds
    E7             Am7      Am9

Yesterday, you asked me something I thought you knew

[Verse 1]
    D     G                          C     G
She was a fast machine, she kept her motor clean
C       G   D                     G D     G
She was the best damn woman that I ever seen
    D       G                  C       G    C  G
She had the sightless eyes, telling me no lies
D                          G    D   G
Knockin' me out with those American thighs
 
D      G                        C           G     C
Taking more than her share, had me fighting for air
G   D                          G    D       G
She told me to come, but I was already there
 D         G                        C     G   C
'Cause the walls start shaking, the earth was quaking
G  D                    D
My mind was aching, and we were making it
 
[Chorus]
    G            Cadd9 G/B   D      Cadd9  G/B
And you shook me all   night long

Working double time on the seduction line
G       D                        G      D   G
She was one of a kind, she's just mine, all mine
D      G                 C     G      C
Wanted no applause, just another course
G    D                G          D      G
Made a meal out of me and come back for more
 
D      G                    C  G       C
Had to cool me down to take another round
G   D                            G  D       G
Now I'm back in the ring to take another swing
 D         G                       C     G   C
'Cause the walls were shaking, the earth was quaking
G  D                    D
My mind was aching, and we were making it
 
[Chorus]
    G            Cadd9 G/B   D      Cadd9  G/B
And you shook me all   night long
       G           Cadd9 G/B   D         Cadd9      G/B
Yeah, you shook me all   night long  And knocked me out
       G            Cadd9 G/B   D      Cadd9         G/B
I said you shook me all   night long      You had me shakin'
    G            Cadd9 G/B   D
and you shook me all   night long

   You really got me and you shook me all   night long
 
[Outro]
          G/B     D      Cadd9        G/B     D

I like the dimples on the corners of the smile that you wear

to be your favorite jacket, just so I could always be near

I loved you for so long, sometimes it's hard to bear

I like the way you hit the notes, in every song you're shining

I love the little things, like when you're unaware

I catch you steal a glance and smile so perfectly

Em               A
Baby you're the one, I don't know how

In a world devoid of life, you bring color

In your eyes I see the light, my future

I'm in love with you, and now you know

[Verse 1]
F#m                    E
Hello darkness, my old friend
                           F#m
I've come to talk with you again
                      D     A
Because a vision softly creeping
                       D       A
Left its seeds while I was sleeping
        D                             A
And the vision that was planted in my brain
        F#m              E        F#m
Still remains within the sound of silence
 
[Verse 2]
F#m                        E
In restless dreams I walked alone
                        F#m
Narrow streets of cobblestone
                   D        A
'Neath the halo of a street lamp
                          D        A
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
        D                                        A
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
               F#m  A
That split the night
                E        F#m
And touched the sound of silence
 
[Verse 3]
F#m                      E
And in the naked light I saw
                          F#m
Ten thousand people, maybe more
                  D       A
People talking without speaking
                  D       A
People hearing without listening
               D                       A
People writing songs that voices never share
           F#m
And no one dare
            E        F#m
Disturb the sound of silence
 
[Verse 4]
F#m                     E
Fools said I, you do not know
                      F#m
Silence like a cancer grows
                      D          A
Hear my words that I might teach you
                     D          A
Take my arms that I might reach you
       D                           A        F#m  A
But my words like silent raindrops fell
                  E        F#m
And echoed in the wells of silence
 
[Verse 5]
F#m                      E
And the people bowed and prayed
                   F#m
To the neon God they made
                         D       A
And the sign flashed out it's warning
                      D       A
And the words that it was forming
N.C.
And the sign said
    D                                               A
The words of the prophets are written on the subway walls
              F#m
And tenement halls
                     E        F#m
And whispered in the sound of silence

Every single lie that tells me I will never measure up
F                              Am                     Dm     Bb
Am I more than just the sum of every high and every low?
F                               Am                     Dm   Bb
Remind me once again just who I am, because I need to know
 
 
[Chorus]
             F                         Am
You say I am loved when I can't feel a thing
             Dm                       Bb
You say I am strong when I think I am weak
             F                      Am
You say I am held when I am falling short
               Dm                         Bb
When I don't belong, oh You say that I am Yours
      F             Am
And I believe, oh I believe
         Dm
What You say of me
    Bb
I believe

    F                              Am                      Dm     Bb
The only thing that matters now is everything You think of me
   F                             Am            Dm       Bb
In You I find my worth, in You I find my identity, o-ooh

Taking all I have and now I'm laying it at Your feet
    F                           Am                     Dm      Bb
You have every failure God, and You'll have every victory, o-ooh

You say I am held when I am falling short

When I don't belong, oh You say that I am Yours

Oh I believe

[Verse 1]
                    Em
It starts with One thing I don't know why
        D
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
        C
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme
        D
To explain in due time
        Em
All I know Time is a valuable thing
        D
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
        C
Watch it count down to the end of the day
        D
The clock ticks life away
          Em
It's so unreal Didn't look out below
        D
Watch the time go right out the window
        C
Trying to hold on but didn't even know
        D
Wasted it all just to
                Em
Watch you go I kept everything inside 
                D
And even though I tried it all fell apart

What it meant to me will eventually

Be a memory of a time when

One thing I don't know why

Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme

To remind myself how
           Em
I tried so hard In spite of the way you were mocking me
D
Acting like I was part of your property
  C
Remembering all the times you've fought with me
        D                Em
I'm surprised it got so (far)
Em
Things aren't the way they were before
D
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
C
Not that you knew me back then
       D
But it all comes back to me
        Em

You kept everything inside

G          D/F#              Em
I close my eyes and I can see

The world that's waiting up for me
       D/F#      C
That I call my own

Here's my version of the Who's ""Behind Blue Eyes"" for acoustic guitar.
I like to use sus chords in place of many major and minor chords
because it leaves the voicings open to interpretation - however,
you can replace my sus chords with either major or minor chords, you'll
just need to see which works best for you (the original Who version has
dedicated major or minor chords) - it's a great song, so have fun.

Put your finger down my throat

 I can take the rain on the roof of this empty house,
             D
That don't bother me,
Em7                D                          C
 I can take a few tears now and then and just let em out,

Em7                          D                       Cadd9
   It's hard to force that smile when I see our old friends and I'm alone,
        D
Still harder,
Cadd9                                  D
Gettin up, gettin dressed, livin with this regret,

But I know if I could do it over,     I would trade, give away

All the words that I saved in my heart that I left unspoken

[Verse 1]
         Bm                    G
You'll remember me when the west wind moves
                     D
Upon the fields of barley
         Bm                  G      D
You'll forget the sun in his jealous sky
      G/B      A             Bm7 G D
As we walk in fields of gold
 
 
[Verse 2]
       Bm                     G
So she took her love for to gaze awhile
                      D
Upon the fields of barley
     Bm                      G         D
In his arms she fell as her hair came down
     G/B   A           D
Among the fields of gold
 
 
[Verse 3]
       Bm                       G
Will you stay with me, will you be my love
                        D
Among the fields of barley
       Bm                     G       D
We'll forget the sun in his jealous sky
      G/B      A           Bm7 G D
As we lie in fields of gold
 
 
[Verse 4]
         Bm                     G
See the west wind move like a lover so
                     D
Upon the fields of barley
         Bm                  G         D
Feel her body rise when you kiss her mouth
     G/B   A          D
Among the fields of gold
 
 
[Bridge]
G             D
I never made promises lightly
G                   D
And there have been some that I've broken
G                  D
But I swear in the days still left
       G/B     A          D
We'll walk in fields of gold
       G/B     A          D
We'll walk in fields of gold

Many years have passed since those summer days
                      D
Among the fields of barley
      Bm                     G        D
See the children run as the sun goes down
     G/B  A          D
Among the fields of gold
 
 
[Verse 6]

You'll remember me when the west wind moves

Upon the fields of barley
         Bm                 G       D
You can tell the sun in his jealous sky
         G/B       A          D
When we walked in fields of gold
         G/B       A          D
When we walked in fields of gold

When we walked in fields of gold

 Old Laughing Lady : Unplugged
 
 G    C G
 
 G
 Don't call pretty Peggy, 
 
 C                     G
 She can't hear you no more 
 
 
 Don't leave no message
 
 C              G
 Round her back door
 
              C
 They say the old laughing lady
 
             G
 Been here before
 
     D               C
 She don't keep time 
 
                 G
 She don't count score
 
 G  C G
 
 G
 You can't have a cupboard
 
 C                 G
 If there ain't no  wall
 
 
 You got to move
 
 C
 There's no time for you to stall
 
              C            020010 Am
 They say the old laughing lady   
 
         C     D    G
 Dropped by to call 
 
     D               Am
 And when she leaves 
 
            C          G
 She leaves nothing at all
 
 
 verse: (without the run through Am)
 
 G
 See the drunkard of the village
 
 C              G
 Fallin' on his feet
 
 
 He can't tell his ankle
 
 C                    G
 From the rest of his feet

 notes: the quick change to C and G at the end on many lines is omitted
 it occurs everywhere but  'if there ain't no wall / you got to move...'
 the run through from C to Am via the B note is a familiar ny trick...

 Mr. Soul : Unplugged
 
 (Tune the guitar down to D)
 
 E E E E
 
 E
 Oh hello Mr. Soul I droped by to pick up a reason 
 
         E
 For the thought that I'd caught that my head is the event of the season 
 
        A                                             E
 Why in crowds just a trace of my face should seem so pleasin'
 
      D                           A                       E
 I'll cop out to the change but a stranger is putting the tease on
 
 D  G D  x2
 
 
 I was down on a frown when a messenger brought me a letter
 I was raised by the praise of a fan who said I upset her
 Any girl in the world could have esaily known me better
 She said 'You're stange, but don't change' and I let her
 
 D
 
 In a while well the smile on my face turned to plaster
 Stick around while the clown who was sick does the trick of disaster
 For the race of my head and my face is moving much faster
 Is it strange I should change? I don't know - why don't you ask her
 
       D                                A
 Is it strange I should change? I don't know
 
       D                                A
 Is it strange I should change? I don't know

 Aurora Borealis

 The icy sky at night

 Paddles cut the water
 
      D
 In a long and hurried flight
 
          A         C       G         D
 From the white man  to the fields of green
 
         A        C      G     D
 and the homeland  we've never seen
 
 D   Em D
 
 
 They killed us in our teepees
 And they cut our women down
 They might have left some babies
 Cryin' on the ground
 But the firesticks and the wagons come
 And the night falls on the settin' sun
 
 D D Em D A C G D
 
 They massacred the buffalo
 Kitty corner from the bank
 The taxis run across my feet
 And my eyes have turned to blanks
 In my little box at the top of the stairs
 With my indian rug and a pipe to share
 
 D D Em D  A C G D   A C G D
 
 (verse:)
 
 
 I wish I was a trapper
 I would give a thousand pelts
 To sleep with Pocahontas
 and find out how she felt
 In the mornin' on the fields of green
 In the homeland we've never seen
 
 D
 
 And maybe Marlon Brando
 Will be there by the fire
 We'll sit and talk of Hollywood
 And the good things there for hire
 And the Astradome and the first teepee
 Marlon Brando, Pocahontas and me
 Marlon Brando, Pocahontas and me

 You can say the soul is gone
 
         Dm/G
 And the feelings just not there
 
 Bb          C            F  C Bb C
 Not like it was so long ago      
 
        F
 On the empty page before you
 
         Dm/G
 You can fill in what you care
 
 Bb             C               F  C Bb C
 Try to make it good before you go      
 
 
 Take the simple case of the sarge
 Who wouldn't go back to war
 Because the hippies tore down every -
 Thing that he was fighting for
 Or the lovers on the blanket
 The city turned to whores
 With memories of green kissed by the sun
 
 
 You can say the soul is gone
 And close another page
 Just be sure that yours is not the one
 
 F C Bb C
 
 
         Bb              F
 And I'm singing for the stringman
 
     Bb              F
 Who lately lost his wife
 
       Bb           Dm
 There is no dearer friend of mine
 
      C              F
 That I know in this life
 
 
 On his shoulder is a violin
 For his head where chaos reigns
 But his heart can't find a simple way
 To live with all those things
 
           F      C Bb C
 All those things      
 
        F         C Bb C
 He's a stringman      
 
   F         C Bb C

 Once I thought I saw you in a crowded, hazy bar,

 Dancing on the light from star to star. 
 
 Am                           G
 Far across the moon beams, I know that's who you are.

 And I'm getting blown away.

 There's somewhere safer where the feelings stay.

 I wanna love you but I'm getting blown away.        
 
 
 I am just a dreamer, but you are just a dream,
 And you could have been anyone to me.
 Before that moment you touched my lips, that
 Perfect feeling when time just slips
 Away between us and our foggy trips.

 this is only a basic outlay - there are lots of variations you can do:
 hammering on or not, using the 5th string (the root of the chord) or the
 open 4th string (D) as the bass note, or to alternate. eg

 With dream comfort memory to spare,
 
 C         G            F
 And in my mind I still need a place to go,
 
 C      G            F
 All my changes were there,
 
 
 Blue, blue windows behind the stars,
 Yellow moon on the rise,
 Big birds flying across the sky,
 Throwing shadows on our eyes. Leave us...

 But you can't feel it
 Livin' like I do
 It's hard to see it
 Was I hurt too bad?
 Can I show you daylight?
 How could I be sad
 When I know that you might
 
 Look out for my love (x4)
 
 C
 Look out for my love
 
 Em
 It's in your neighbourhood
 
 Am
 I know things are gonna change
 
       G
 But I can't say good or bad
 
 
 Silver wings of morning
 Shining in the grey day
 While the ice is forming
 On a lonely runway
 
 Hydraulic wipers pumping
 Till the window glistens
 Something saying something
 But no one seems to listen
 
 Men wth walkie-talkies
 Men with flash-lights waving
 Up upon the tower
 Time reads daylight savings
 
 I'm home again to you babe
 You know it makes me wonder
 Sittin' in the quiet slipstream
 In the thunder
 
 Bm           G
 Look out for my love (x10)

 We've been through some things together,
 
 Bm             G        A
 With trunks of memories still to come.
 
 D        A/D             G      D
 We found things to do in stormy weather.
 
 Bm   A       D

 Although these changes have come.
 
 D                      A/D
 With your chrome heart shinin'
 
 G      D    Bm   A       D
 in the sun, long may you run. 
 
 G Bb
 
 
 Well it was back in Blind River in nineteen sixtytwo
 When I last saw you alive.
 But we missed that ship on the long decline.
 Long may you run.
 
 chorus:
 
 D Dsus4 D
 
 verse:
 
 Maybe the Beach Boys have got you now
 With those waves singin' Caroline.
 Rollin' down that empty ocean road,
 Get into the surf on time.

 G            Bm       C                           Am
 From Hank to Hendrix, I walked these streets with you.
 
 Em                  G           C            Am
 Here I am with this old guitar, doing what I do.

 I always expected, that you would see me through.
 
 Em        G               C                 Am   G
 I never believed in much, but I believed in you. 
 
 
 chorus:
 F                              C                   G
 Can we get it together, can we still stand side by side.
 
 F                    C              G
 Can we make it last, like a musical ride?
 
 
 From Marilyn to Madonna, I always loved  your smile,
 Now we're headed for the big divorce, California style.
 I found myself singin'  like a long lost friend
 The same thing that makes you live can kill you in the end.
 
 chorus:
 
 Sometimes its distorted not clear to you.
 Sometimes the beauty of love just comes ringin' through.
 New glass in the window, new leaf on the tree,
 new distance between us you and me.
 
 chorus:
 
 
 notes:
 use G 320033 or Giii rather than a straight open G?

Artist: John Mayer
Info:  technically this is different than how he plays it, but if you are going to be
alone, then i think this sounds better anyway.  However, it is in the same key. (play
with the youtube video to hear for yourself)
CAPO 1 CAPO 1 CAPO 1.  Capo 1 is the correct key, but it sounds good w/o one. I dont
what the technical name for the B chord is but this is how you finger it: (B)
E-0       THE A IS ACTUALLY AN Asus2, but for SIMPLICITY, let's call it A
A-2        Asus2
D-4        E-0        Here's E:
G-4        A-0        E-0-|
B-0        D-2        A-2-|
E-0        G-2        D-2-|
           B-0        G-1
           E-0        B-0

[Verse 1]
   Cadd9                       G
Umuwi lang tila bang lahat nagbago na
     Em7                        G
Nawalan na ng sigla ang iyong mga mata
           Cadd9                 G
Ngayon ko lang naramdaman ang lamig ng gabi

[Verse 2]

Binibilang ang hakbang hanggang wala ka na
            Em7                G
Nagbabakasakaling lilingon ka pa
          Cadd9             G
Hindi na ba mababalik ang mga sandali

Subject: Re: REQ: Beer Drinkin' and Hell Raisin' -- ZZ TOP
 
The rhythm is repetitious, a straightforward 12 bar blue pattern. I don't
play the solo on this one, just the rhythm, so that's all I've provided.
I play it with these chords:
 
Em7     075700
E       X7999X
D       X5777X
A5      57XXXX

B5      79XXXX
B6      711XXXX
 
BEER DRINKERS AND HELL RAISERS              ZZTOP
 
Intro (twice)
 
Em7 groove, ending with:

------5-7p5h7-----------

Em7
If you see me walkin' down the line,
with my fav'rite honky tonk in mind,
 
well, I'll be here around suppertime
        Em7                 E     D
with my can of dinner and a bunch of fine...

Beer drinkers and hell raisers, yeah. 
 
B5 B6 B5 B6 A5    A6        A5    A6        Em7 (with intro riff)
Uh-huh-huh, baby, don't you wanna come with me?
 
 
 
The crowd gets loud when the band gets right,
steel guitar cryin' through the night.
 
Yeah, try'n to cover up the corner fight but
ev'rything's cool 'cause they's just tight.
 
Beer drinkers and hell raisers, yeah.
Huh, baby, don't you wanna come with me?
 
        Ah, play it boy.
        (Solo)
 
The joint was jumpin' like a cat on hot tin.
Lord, I thought the floor was gonna give in.
 
Soundin' a lot like a House Congressional
'cause we're experimental and professional.
 
Beer drinkers, hell raisers, yeah.
Well, baby, don't you wanna come with me?

[Chorus]
                      C
I'm looking at you through the glass
                     D
Don't know how much time has passed
            Em
Oh God, it feels like forever
 
But no one ever tells you
       C
That forever feels like home
 D                            Em
Sitting all alone inside your head
 
                           C
Cause I'm looking at you through the glass
                     D
Don't know how much time has passed
                       Em
All I know is that it feels like forever
 
But no one ever tells you
        C
That forever feels like home
 D                            Em
Sitting all alone inside your head
 
[Verse 1]
             C
How do you feel?
                D
That is the question
         Em
But I forget
 
You don't expect an easy answer
      C
When something like a soul
          D
Becomes initialized
                    Em
And folded up like paper dolls and little notes
 
You can't expect a bit of hope
       C
And while you're outside looking in
     D
Describing what you see
   Em
Remember what you're staring at is me
 
[Chorus]
                           C
Cause I'm looking at you through the glass

[Verse 2]
             C
How much is real?
             D
So much to question
       Em
An epidemic of the mannequins
 
Contaminating everything
    C
we thought came from the heart
    D
It never did, right from the start
Em
  Just listen to the noises (Null and void instead of voices)
C
  Before you tell yourself
      D
It's just a different scene
  Em
Remember it's just different from what you've seen

I've put both Am and Am7 as I'm not sure exactly which is the original chord. I
prefer Am7 when I'm playing with a capo. But it's really down to the individual
and how you hear it.
 
To make this a bit more interesting, try hammering on the e when playing the D and
Am chords. Listen to the song for the timing.
 
 
[Verse 1]
 
G               D
Maybe I don't really want to know
         Am
How your garden grows
  C             D
As I just want to fly
G               D
Lately did you ever feel the pain
         Am
In the morning rain
  C                    D
As it soaks you to the bone
 
 
[Chorus 1]
 
Em                   D
Maybe I just want to fly

Wanna live, I don't want to die
                     C
Maybe I just want to breathe
      D            Em
Maybe I just don't believe
                       D
Maybe you're the same as me

How your garden grows
      C              D
Cause I just want to fly
G                    D
Lately did you ever feel the pain
                Am
In the morning rain

As it soaks you to the bone
 
 
[Chorus 2]
 
Em                 D
Maybe I will never be
                          Am
All the things that I wanna be
                       C
Now is not the time to cry
          D               Em
Now's the time to find out why
                          D
I think you're the same as me

I've got seven women on my mind.

   Risin' up, back on the street,

  Did my time, took my chances.
Am                             F
  Went the distance, now I'm back on my feet,
        G                     Am
Just a man and his will to survive.
 
Am                  F
  So many times, it happens too fast,

Hangin' tough, stayin' hungry.
Am                             F
They stack the odds, still we take to the street,
        G                     Am
For we kill with the skill to survive.

A           F#m      Em    A
Every day together, always
  Bm       F#m         Em         A
I really feel that I'm losing my best friend
  F#m                 Bm       Em     A
I can't believe this could be the end
   Bm         F#m    Em           A
It looks as though you're letting go
    D                  A               B
And if it's real, well I don't want to know

Don't speak,

[Verse 2]
 
    Bm       F#m           Em
Our memories they can be inviting
             A          F#m      Em        A
But some are altogether mighty frightening
 Bm   F#m   Em          A
As we die, both you and I
D                     A              B
  With my head in my hands I sit and cry

Em   D    Cadd9
Save your smile
Em         D              Cadd9
Everything fades through time
    Em   D    Cadd9
I'm lost for words

Em              D               Cadd9
I'm completely trapped in your soul
Em      D     Cadd9
Dazed and confused
Em          D            C
Swept away with your own words
Em       D  C
You're my star
Em           D            C
Invincible, haunting and far
Em     D     C
Grace under fire
Em            D          C
Something is deep in my heart
      D
In my heart

[Bridge]
 
Am      Bm          C
Slowly falling into you

  C                        Am            F
Seems like theres always someone who disapproves
        C                  Am                F
They'll judge it like they know about me and you
          C                 Am           F
And the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do
            C  G/B                F   G/B
The jury's out, but my choice is you
 
 
[Chorus]
 
    F                    G
So don't you worry your pretty little mind
  C                   Am
People throw rocks at things that shine
     F          G          Am
And life makes love look hard
                 F
The stakes are high
             G
The waters rough
 
But this love is ours
 
C  Am  F
 
C Am   F
 
[Verse]
 
 C                   Am                     F
You never know what people have up their sleeves
 C                     Am                F
Ghosts from your past gonna jump out at me
 C               Am                 F
Lurking in the shadows with their lip gloss smiles
             C   G/B                        F    G/B
But I don't care, cause right now you're mine
 
 
[Chorus]
 
                F                     G
And you'll say don't you worry your pretty little mind
  C                   Am
People throw rocks at things that shine
     F          G         Am
And life makes love look hard
                F
The stakes are high
             G
The waters rough
 
But this love is ours
 
C  Am  F
 
C  Am  F
 
 
[Bridge]
 
Am              G            F
And it's not theirs to speculate
         C    G   Am             G
If it's wrong and your hands are tough 
             F          C      G
but they are where mine belong and
Am                 G
I'll fight their doubt and give you
F               C    G   F     G
faith with this song for you
 
 
[Verse]
 
C                Am                F
Cause I love the gap between your teeth
C                Am               F
And I love the riddles that you speak
          C                    Am             F
And any snide remarks from my father about your tattoos 
C               G/B                  F    G/B
will be ignored cause my heart is yours
 
 
[Chorus]
 
    F                     G
So don't you worry your pretty little mind
  C                   Am
People throw rocks at things that shine
     F           G        Am
And life makes love look hard
 
 
[Chorus]
 
    F                     G
So don't you worry your pretty little mind
  C                   Am
People throw rocks at things that shine
     F          G          C    Am
But they can't take what's ours
 F          G           Am
They can't take what's ours
                F
The stakes are high
             G
The waters rough
                  C
But this love is ours

         Em      B7              Em    Em7
Is there anybody going to listen to my story
Am            C6               G      B7
All about the girl who came to stay?
          Em               B7              Em        Em7
She's the kind of girl you want so much it makes you sorry

When I think of all the times I've tried so hard to leave her

She will turn to me and start to cry

Was she told when she was young that pain would lead to pleasure?

Did she understand it when they said

That a man must break his back to earn his day of leisure,

Will she still believe it when he's dead?

E F#     G#m
I found god

On the corner of first and Amistad
E     F#   G#m      F#  B   E
Where the west was all but won
E   F# G#m F#      B         E
All alone  smoking his last cigarette
       E     F#  G#m           F#  B  E
I Said where you been, he said ask anything
 
 
[Verse 1]

Where were you?
     F#         B       E
When everything was falling apart
C#5 D#5 G#m        F#    B      E
All my days were spent by the telephone
   C#5 D#5 G#m
It ne-ver rang
    F#    B      E
And all I needed was a call
     C#5 D#5 G#m
That ne-ver   came
       F#        B         E        C#5 D#5
To the corner of first and Amistad

Surrounded, surrounded
G#m               E
Why’d you have to wait?
B             F#/C# F#
Where were you? Where were you?
G#m           E
Just a little late

[Verse 2]
 
E  F#  G#m  F#  B        E
In the end everyone ends up alone
E  F#  G#m      F#    B        E
Losing her, the only one who’s ever known
E  F# G#m          F#   B    E
Who I am, who I’m not, who I want to be
   E  F#  G#m       F#      B       E           C#5 D#5

Early morning, City breaks
F#   B    Esus2       F#         B        Esus2
I’ve been calling for years and years and years and years
                            F#
And you never left me no messages
                      Esus2
You never send me no letters

      Am
There once was a ship that put to sea
         Dm                       Am
And the name of that ship was the Billy o' Tea
     Am
The winds blew hard, her bow dipped down
 E                    Am
Blow, me bully boys, blow (huh!)
 
[Chorus]
 
 F            C
Soon may the Wellerman come
    Dm                Am
To bring us sugar and tea and rum
F                  C
One day, when the tonguin’ is done,
       E                 Am
We’ll take our leave and go
 
[Verse 2]
 
    Am
She had not been two weeks from shore
      Dm            Am
When down on her a right whale bore
     Am
The captain called all hands and swore
      E                 Am
He'd take that whale in tow (huh!)
 
[Chorus]
 
 F            C
Soon may the Wellerman come
    Dm                Am
To bring us sugar and tea and rum
F                  C
One day, when the tonguin’ is done,
       E                 Am
We’ll take our leave and go
 
[Verse 3]
 
   Am
Before the boat had hit the water
      Dm              Am
The whale's tail came up and caught her
     Am
All hands to the side, harpooned and fought her
      E                Am
When she dived down below (huh!)
 
[Chorus]
 
 F            C
Soon may the Wellerman come
    Dm                 Am
To bring us sugar and tea and rum
F                 C
One day, when the tonguin’ is done,
       E                 Am
We’ll take our leave and go
 
[Verse 4]
 
    Am
No line was cut, no whale was freed;
     Dm                Am
The Captain's mind was not on greed
    Am
But he belonged to the whaleman's creed;
     E                 Am
She took that ship in tow (huh!)
 
[Chorus]
 
 F            C
Soon may the Wellerman come
    Dm                 Am
To bring us sugar and tea and rum
F                 C
One day, when the tonguin’ is done,
       E                 Am
We’ll take our leave and go
 
[Verse 5]
 
     Am
For forty days, or even more
     Dm                    Am
The line went slack, then tight once more
     Am
All boats were lost (there were only four)
      E                  Am
But still that whale did go
 
[Chorus]
 
 F            C
Soon may the Wellerman come
    Dm                 Am
To bring us sugar and tea and rum
F                 C
One day, when the tonguin’ is done,
       E                 Am
We’ll take our leave and go
 
[Verse 6]
 
   Am
As far as I've heard, the fight's still on;
     Dm                     Am
The line's not cut and the whale's not gone
     Am
The Wellerman makes his regular call
     Dm                    Am
To encourage the Captain, crew, and all
 
[Chorus]
 
 F            C
Soon may the Wellerman come
    Dm                 Am
To bring us sugar and tea and rum
F                 C
One day, when the tonguin’ is done,
       E                 Am G
We’ll take our leave and go
 
 F            C
Soon may the Wellerman come
    Dm                 Am
To bring us sugar and tea and rum
F                 C
One day, when the tonguin’ is done,
       E                 Am
We’ll take our leave and go

Em                     B/D#                      Em
Seems like it was yesterday when I saw your face
                      C                          Am
You told me how proud you were, but I walked away
                      B
If only I knew what I know today
Em
Ooooooo
 
 
[Pre-Chorus 1]
 
        C
I would hold you in my arms
        A/C#
I would take the pain away
D
Thank you for all you've done
   B/D#
Forgive all your mistakes
        C
There's nothing I wouldn't do
   A/C#
to hear your voice again
    D
Sometimes I wanna call you
      B/D#
But I know you won't be there

Em               B/D#                     Em
Some days I feel broke inside but I won't admit
                       C                    Am
Sometimes I just wanna hide cause it's you I miss
                                B
And it's so hard to say goodbye, when it comes to this
Em
Oooooo
 
 
[Pre-Chorus 2]
 
          C
Would you tell me I was wrong
          A/C#
Would you help me understand
        D
Are you looking down upon me
        B/D#
Are you proud of who I am
        C
There's nothing I wouldn't do
   A/C#
To have just one more chance

To look into your eyes
    B/D#
And see you looking back

And I hurt myself, ohh

Em                       C
  If I had just one more day
        Em                                                        C
I would tell you how much that I've missed you since you've been away

And oh, it's dangerous And so out of line

To try and turn back time

Em     B/D#                   Em
Woah, I'm sorry for, blaming you

For everything, I just couldn't do

Em           B
You were my sun

You were my earth
Em              B                  C            Am
But you didn't know all the ways I loved you, no
Em              B
So you took a chance
C               Am
And made other plans
Em                    B                           C              Am

Em                  B
You don't have to say, what you did,
  C              Am
I already know, I found out from him
Em                              B                    C
Now there's just no chance, for you and me, there'll never be

You told me you loved me

Em                   B                      C
Your bridges were burned, and now it's your turn

It wasn't like you only talked to him and you know it

All of these things people told me

Keep messing with my head

Em                   B
You should've picked honesty

I already know, I found out from him
(I already know, uh)
Em                              B                    C

[Verse 1]
D                                      A
Scrolling through my cellphone for the 20th time today
Em
Reading the text you sent me again
         G
Though I memorized it anyway
          D
It was an afternoon in December
          A
When it reminded you of the day
        Em
When we bumped into each other
        G
But you didn't say hi 'cause I looked away
 
[Pre-chorus]
    Em                 D                      G
And maybe that was the biggest mistake of my life
    Em              D                 A (strum down)
And maybe I haven't moved on since that night
 
[Chorus]
           D           A
Cause it's 12:51 and I thought my feelings were gone
         Em              G
But I'm lying on my bed, thinking of you again
        D                            A
And the moon shines so bright, but I gotta dry these tears tonight
             Em                                   G           D
Cause you're moving on and I'm not that strong to hold on any longer
 
[Interlude]
A Em     G
Oh Oh Oh Oh...
 
[Verse 2]
D
Then I saw you with her
       A
Didn't think you'd find another
        Em
And the world just seemed to crash
G
Shouldn't have thought that this would last
 
[Pre-chorus]
    Em                 D                      G
And maybe that was the biggest mistake of my life
    Em              D                 A (strum down)
And maybe I haven't moved on since that night
 
[Chorus]

Cause it's 12:51 and I thought my feelings were gone

But I'm lying on my bed, thinking of you again

And the moon shines so bright, but I gotta dry these tears tonight
             Em                                   G           Bm
Cause you're moving on and I'm not that strong to hold on any longer
 
[Bridge]
Bm                           D
As the sky outside gets brighter
                      Em
And my eyes begin to tire
           G
I'm slowly drowning
                 Bm
In memories of him
                        D
And I know it shouldn't matter
                      Em
As my heart begins to shatter
              G
I'm left to wonder
                         A
Just how it should have been... yeah...
 
[Chorus]
D              A
12:51 and I thought my feelings were gone
        Em                       G
But I'm lying on my bed, I'm not thinking of you again
        D                            A
And the moon shines so bright, but I gotta dry these tears tonight
             Em                                   G
Cause you're moving on and I'm not that strong to hold on
           Em                                         G
Cause I'll prove you wrong that I can move on through this song
        D
So much stronger

Well sometimes I go out by myself and I look across the water

Wish I could

https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/iron-wine/flightless-bird-american-mouth-chords-582263,beginner,E A D G B E,,3rd fret,"['C', 'F', 'G', 'Am']","This is all very simple. The whole song follows this same pattern: Am, C, F, G.
It's on the 3rd fret, and these chords are relative to the capo.
It's 3/4 timing, like a waltz, so strum appropriately. Each chord gets exactly 4
and this does not change.
 
Flightless Bird, American Mouth
by Iron & Wine
 
 
[Verse 1]
        C
I was a quick wet boy
           Am
Diving too deep for coins
            F
All of your street light eyes
          G
Wide on my plastic toys
             C
And when the cops closed the fair
         Am
I cut my long baby hair
           F
Stole me a dog-eared map
                  G
And called for you everywhere
 
[Chorus]
      C
Have I found you?
Am               F        G
Flightless bird, jealous, weeping
 C
Or lost you?
 Am
American mouth
F        G
Big pill looming
 
[Verse 2]
          C
Now I’m a fat house cat
           Am
Nursing my sore blunt tongue
             F
Watching the warm poison rats
                 G
Curl through the wide fence cracks
           C
Pissing on magazine
            Am
Photos, those fishing lures
               F
Thrown in the cold and clean
               G
Blood of Christ mountain stream
 
[Chorus]
      C
Have I found you?
Am               F         G
Flightless bird, grounded, bleeding
 C
Or lost you?
 Am
American mouth
F         G          C
Big pill, stuck going down

[Verse]
F                                 Am
God knows what is hiding in those weak and drunken hearts
            G         Gsus4    G
I guess he kissed the girls and made them cry 
      F
those hardfaced queens of misadventure
F                                 Am
God knows what is hiding in those weak and sunken eyes
  G             Gsus4   G
a fiery throng of muted angels
       F
Giving love but getting nothing back
 
[Chorus]
F               Am
People help the people
              G
And if you're homesick 
                           F
Give me your hand and I'll hold it
F               Am
People help the people

And nothing will drag you down

Oh and if I had a brain,

Oh and if I had a brain

I'd be cold as a stone and rich as the fool
     Dm               E7           F         F
That turned, all those good hearts away
 
[Verse]
F                                Am
God knows what is hiding, in this world of little consequence
            G      Gsus4   G
Behind the tears, inside the lies
  F               F
A thousand slowly dying sunsets
F                                 Am
God knows what is hiding in those weak and drunken hearts
  G              Gsus4   G
I guess the loneliness came knocking
       F                   F
No one needs to be alone, oh save me

This song will be played in an open G tuning so that means EADGBe will be XGDGBD.
Take the lowest E off, tune the 'A' string to a 'G' and tune the highest E to a 'D'.
Now you have a tuning like this: XBDGBD
You can also tune the lowest 'E' down a 'D'. Then, in case you happen to hit it...
the chords will still sound OK

a glass of wine in her hand

to get my fair share of abuse
   G   Gadd9 G                 C
Singing, ""we're gonna vent our frustration,

I sung my song to Mr. Jimmy,

   (Basically: C#m-B--E-A--E-A-B-E : repeat many times through the song)
 
 
VERSE 1:
C#m   B    E          A
One, two boys by the river
E            A
Down by the water
   C#m      B              E
Tellin' riddles in the dark
C#m       B     E          A
With fireflies under the moonlight
E           A             C#m  B        E
Carvin' the insides of a tree with a knife
 
 
BRIDGE:
C#m           B             A         E
Ever hear the one about the boy's big sister

  His best friend come along
E           B
He tried to kiss her
 
 
CHORUS:
         A
The only difference
       E/G#
That I see
            F#m
Is you are exactly the same
        B
As you used to be
 
 
VERSE:
One boy lives in a tower
With bow and arrow
And the artificial heart
With his girl
Late in the summer
He loaded the cannon
With a jealous appetite
They say that children now
They come in all ages
And maybe sometimes old men die
With little boy faces
 
 
(Chorus)
 
 
BRIDGE:
C#m  B    A    E
You always said that you needed some
C#m  B    A    E    B
But you always had more, more than anyone

[Verse 1]
 
G                  B
 So, you're on the prowl wondering whether
C
 She left already or not
Am                      D
 Leather jacket, collar popped like Cantona
G
 Never knowing when to stop
 
G                    B
 Sunglasses indoors, par for the course
C
Lights in the floors and sweat on the walls
Am D               G
   Cages and poles
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
G                            B
 Call off the search for your soul
             C
Or put it on hold again
                           Am
She's having a sly indoor smoke
                  D                      G
And she calls the folks who run this her oldest friends
 
G                                          B
 Sipping a drink and laughing at imaginary jokes
              C                                      Am
As all the signals are sent, her eyes invite you to approach
                D                          Cm
And it seems as though those lumps in your throat

That you just swallowed have got you going

Come on, come on, come on
        Cm        G
Number one party anthem
 
 
[Verse 3]
 
G             B
 She's a certified mind blower
C
 Knowing full well that I don't
Am                             D
 May suggest there's somewhere from which you might know her
G
 Just to get the ball to roll
 
G                    B
 Drunken monologues, confused because
     C
It's not like I'm falling in love
                   Am         D
I just want you to do me no good
        Cm              D
And you look like you could

 The look of love - the rush of blood

Now the rhythm guitar starts strumming the chords. The lead should continue finger-
picking the chords because the rest of the song doesn't really have any consistent
riffs or licks and it is boring for your audience if you emulate every nuance of
Keith Richards and Mick Taylor's fingerpickings.

          G      D      Em     G7/F       C   Cm         G
There are places I'll remember     all my li--ife though some have changed,

Some are dead and some are living, in my life I've loved them all.

[Chorus]
 
C     F         C
When somebody loved me
F                 G
everything was beautiful
Em             Am
every hour we spent together
F                G
lives within my heart
 
 
[Post-Chorus]
 
C     F          C
And when she was sad
F               G
I was there to dry her tears
Em               Am           F
and when she was happy so was I
     C      G         C
when she loved me
 
 
[Verse 1]
 
F                           G
Through the summer and the fall
    Em                     Am
we had each other that was all
    Em         Am
just she and I together
     F               G
like it was meant to be
C                 Am
and when she was lonely
F                 G
I was there to comfort her
      Em  Am    C     G         C
and I knew that she loved me
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
Am               G
So the years went by
   Em        Am
I stayed the same
   Em            Am
but she began to drift away
G          Am
I was left alone
Fm             Cm
still I waited for the day
 
when she'd say
Fm      Cm         G
I will always love you
 
 
[Verse 3]
 
C     F     C
Lonely and forgotten
F                    G
never thought she'd look my way
Em                       Am
and she smiled at me and held me
F                     G
just like she used to do
 
C              Am
like she loved me

lives within my heart

C         F/C  C         F/C   C                       F    G

C           F/C   C        F/C     C                    G/D F Em Dm

  Jesus freaks,   out in the street,  handing tickets out for God
C         F/C   C          F/C    C                           F      G

F       Em7  Am7             D/F#  Dm7/F       E7      Am    G7
  Piano man,    he makes his stand,     in the auditorium

Alternatively you can play    instead of     in Chorus, not like in original but sounds better imo.

[Verse 1]
Am                   D
   When a humble bard
                Dm
 Graced a ride along
                Em
 With Geralt of Rivia
             Dsus2    Em  E
 Along came this song
 
[Verse 2 - fingerpicking]
Am                          D/F#
   From when the White Wolf fought
                  Dm
 A silver-tongued devil
             G
 His army of elves
                        D/F#   G  E/G#
 At his hooves did they  revel
 
[Verse 3 - fingerpicking]
Am                 D/F#
   They came after me
                  Dm
 With masterful deceit
               G
 Broke down my lute
          E7           Am
 And they kicked in my teeth
 
[Verse 4 - fingerpicking]
Am                   D/F#
   While the devil’s horns
                   Dm
 Minced our tender meat
                  G
 And so cried the Witcher
             G      E7
 He can’t be bleat
 
[Chorus]
Am        E            C
   Toss a coin to your Witcher
    D             Am
 O’ Valley of Plenty
    Am             Am
 O’ Valley of Plenty
 
Am
Oh, oh, oh
 
Am        E            C
   Toss a coin to Your Witcher

[Verse 5]
Am                    D/F#
   At the edge of the world
                  Dm/F
 Fight the mighty horde
                 G
 That bashes and breaks you
                   D/F#    G   E/G#
 And brings you to mourn 
 
[Verse 6]
Am                 D/F#
   He thrust every elf
                 Dm/F
 Far back on the shelf
                G
 High up on the mountain
                D/F#   G E7
 From whence it came 
 
[Verse 7]
Am                   D/F#
   He wiped out your pest
                   Dm/F
 Got kicked in his chest
                      G
 He’s a friend of humanity
    E7           Am
 So give him the rest
 
[Verse 8]
Am                D/F#
   That’s my epic tale
                 Dm/F
 Our champion prevailed
              G
 Defeated the villain
                       G
 Now pour him some ale
 
[Chorus 2]

[Verse 1]
   Am                       G             Am
As soon as you're born they make you feel small
   Am                    G          Am
By giving you no time instead of it all
         Am                      G          Am
Till the pain is so big you feel nothing at all
  Am                    G            Am
A working class hero is something to be
  Am            G       D            Am
A working class hero is something to be
 
 
[Verse 2]
     Am                        G          Am
They hurt you at home and they hit you at school
     Am                                 G         Am
They hate you if you're clever and they despise a fool
            Am                         G            Am
Till you're so fucking crazy you can't follow their rules
  Am                    G            Am
A working class hero is something to be
  Am            G       D            Am

[Verse 3]
             Am                          G          Am
When they've tortured and scared you for twenty odd years
Am                      G        Am
Then they expect you to pick a career
         Am                           G          Am
When you can't really function you're so full of fear
  Am                    G            Am
A working class hero is something to be
  Am            G       D            Am
A working class hero is something to be
 
 
[Verse 4]
         Am                      G         Am
Keep you doped with religion and sex and T.V.
        Am                         G             Am
And you think you're so clever and classless and free
           Am                        G            Am
But you're still fucking peasants as far as I can see
  Am                    G            Am
A working class hero is something to be
  Am            G       D            Am
A working class hero is something to be
 
 
[Verse 5]
        Am                       G           Am
There's room at the top they are telling you still
    Am                          G            Am
But first you must learn how to smile as you kill
       Am                  G            Am
If you want to be like the folks on the hill
  Am                    G            Am
A working class hero is something to be
  Am            G       D            Am
A working class hero is something to be
 
 
[Outro]
       Am                     G           Am
If you want to be a hero well just follow me

If you want to be a hero well just follow me

[Verse]
 
     A
Deep down in Louisiana, close to New Orleans,
A
Way back up in the woods among the evergreens,
      D
There stood a log cabin made of earth and wood
      A
Where lived a country boy named Johnny B. Goode
    E
Who never ever learned to read or write so well,
             A
But he could play the guitar just like a ringin' a bell.
 
 
[Chorus]
 
    A
Go! Go! Go, Johnny, go! Go!
                 D
Go, Johnny, go! Go!  
 
Go, Johnny, go!
A                   E              A
Go! Go, Johnny, go! Go! Johnny B. Goode
 
 
[Verse]
 
     A
He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack,
A
Go sit beneath the tree by the railroad track.
      D
Old engineers would see him sittin' in the shade,
      A
Strummin' with the rhythm that the drivers made.
    E
When people passed him by they would stop and say,
             A
'oh, my but that little country boy could play'
 
 
[Chorus]
 
    A
Go! Go! Go, Johnny, go! Go!
                 D
Go, Johnny, go! Go!
 
Go, Johnny, go!
A                   E              A
Go! Go, Johnny, go! Go! Johnny B. Goode
 
 
[Verse]
 
     A
His mother told him, 'someday you will be a man,
A
You will be the leader of a big ol' band.

              G
All I hear is raindrops
F#m7             B
falling on the rooftop
Em7
  Oh baby, tell me
          Dm        G

Cause this pain I feel
             Bm Em7
it won't go away
    Am         D7sus4
And today I'm officially missing you

  I thought that from this
F#m7        B             Em7
heartache I could escape
             Dm7
But I've fronted 
      G        C
long enough to know
               Bm  Em7
There ain't no way
     Am         D7sus4

All I do is lay around
                  F#m7   B
two years full of tears
          Em7
From looking at your
            Dm  G
face on the wall
             C
Just a week ago 
              Bm Em7
you were my baby
                       Am
Now I don't even know you at
             B7

       C
Well I wish that you
                    Bm
would call me right now
          Em7
So that I could get
                   C#m
through to you somehow
 
But I guess it's safe to
C        Bm      Em7
say baby safe to say

That I'm officially missing you

[Bridge]

Well, I thought I could 
     G        C
just get over you baby
      F
But I see that's 
          G
something I just can't
C  G/B           Am
do      From the way
          B
you would hold me
       Em7           D C
To the sweet things     
 
(you told me)

Waiting for someone to call out, would you touch me?

Hey you! would you help me to carry the sto-o-one?

Hey you! out there on the road

Hey you! out there beyond the wall

Breaking bottles in the hall, can you help me?
D                                         G  D  C
Hey you! don't tell me there's no hope at a-aa-ll

Sinatra was swinging

  C              Em
I saw her in the rightest way

Looking like Anne Hathaway
C                  Em
Laughing while she hit her pen
    G
And coughed, and coughed
    C                 Em
And then, she came up to my knees
G
Begging, baby, would you please?

Do the things you said you'd do

And when you get a taste, can you tell me what's my flavor?

I don't believe in God, but I believe that you're my savior

She took my fingers to her mouth

The kind of thing that makes you proud

That nothing else had ever
        G
Worked out, worked out
    C             Em
And maybe I tried other things

But nothing can capture the sting

Of the venom, she's gonna spit out right now

And we can run away to the walls inside your house

I can be the cat, baby, you can be the mouse

[VERSE 1]
 
   C
This town is colder now, I think it's sick of us
   Em
It's time to make our move, I'm shakin' off the rust
  C
I've got my heart set on anywhere but here
   Em                                    Am
I'm staring down myself, counting up the years
                              F
Steady hands, just take the wheel
                          Am
And every glance is killing me
                       F
Time to make one last appeal for the life I lead
 
 
[CHORUS]
 
  C
Stop and stare
                         G
I think I'm moving but I go nowhere
                     Am
Yeah, I know that everyone gets scared
                        F        F    G
But I've become what I can't be, oh
 
 C
Stop and stare
                                 G
You start to wonder why you're 'here' not 'there'
                           Am
And you'd give anything to get what's fair
                              F
But fair ain't what you really need
F                       C
Oh, can you see what I see?
 
 
[VERSE 2]
 
   C
They're tryin' to come back, all my senses push
   Em
Untie the weight bags, I never thought I could
  Am
Steady feet, don't fail me now
F
Gonna run till you can't walk
  Am
Something pulls my focus out
                  F
And I'm standing down
 
 
[CHORUS]
 
 C
Stop and stare
                         G

But I've become what I can't be, oh

Stop and stare

You start to wonder why you're 'here' not 'there'

But fair ain't what you really need

Oh, you don't need
    Em       Am        F
    Oh       Oh        Oooooo

E         C#m         A - B
pana-panahon ang pagkakataon 
E          A   B  C#m
maibabalik ba ang kahapon? 
A              B C#m
natatandaan mo pa ba, 
A            B              E - C#m
nang tayong dalwa ang unang nagkita?
A           B C#m
panahon ng kamusmusan
A            B             E - C#m
sa piling ng mga bulaklak at halaman
A       B            C#m
doon tayong nagsimulang
A         B      C#m
mangarap at tumula

natatandaan mo pa ba,
A         B       E         C#m
inukit kong puso sa punong mangga
        A       B       C#m
at ang inalay kong gumamela
A       B            C#m
magkahawak-kamay sa dalampasigan
A                B C#m
 malayang tulad ng mga ibon
A               B E7
 ang gunita ng ating kahapon
 A           B C#m
 ang mga puno't halaman
A                B        E
 ay kabiyak ng ating gunita
A            B       C#m     A         F#m B
 sa paglipas ng panahon bakit kailangan ding lumisan?

A/G# - B/F# - A - B
 
 
(Do chords) as show on above
 
ngayon ikaw ay nagbalik
at tulad ko rin ang iyong pananabik
makita ang dating kanlungan
tahanan ng ating tula at pangarap
ngayon ay naglaho na
saan hahanapin pa?
 
lumilipas ang panahon
kabiyak ng ating gunita
ang mga puno't halaman
bakit kailangan lumisan?

Am                             G
I'll sing it one last time for you
        Am             G
Then we really have to go
                 Am                  G
You've been the only thing that's right
             Am        G
In all i've done.
 
            Am            G
And I can barely look at you
            Am           G
But every single time I do
              Am            G
I know we'll make it anywhere

And we'll run for our lives

I can hardly speak I understand
                                   F
Why you can't raise your voice to say
 
 
[Verse]
 
              Am                 G
To think I might not see those eyes

It makes it so hard not to cry
           Am               G
And as we say our long goodbyes

Slower, Slower. We dont have time for that.

All I want is to find an easier way.
                           F
To get out of our little heads.
C                                   G
Have heart, my dear. We're bound to be afraid.

[Verse]
     E
The birds have left their trees
     F#             G#m
The light pours onto me
       E
I can feel you lying there
            G#m   F#
All on your own
        E
We got here the hard way
           F#               G#m
All those words that we exchanged
E                            G#m  F#
Is it any wonder things get brooooooke
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]

'Cause in my heart and in my head

I'll never take back the things I said,

So high above
   F#
""I feel it coming down"", she said

[Verse]
     E
Now all the birds have fled
     F#                  G#m
The hurt just leaves me scared
 E                           G#m  F#
Losing everything I've ever known
  E
It's all become too much
       F#               G#m
Maybe I'm not built for love
      E
If I knew that I could reach you,
         G#m   F#
I would goooo-oooo
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
     C#m
It's in my heart and in my head
     E
You can't take back the things you said,
   G#m
So high above
    F#
""I feel it coming down"", she said
C#m
In my heart and in my head
 E
Tell my why this has to end
    B
Oh, no
     F#
Oh, noooooooo

G#m              F#
My Atlantis, oh, no

We build it up to pull it down

And we built it up

And we built it up

And we built it up to pull it down

                         Am
We have a list of people that we would take
  Em
A bullet for them, a bullet for you
                    C
A bullet for everybody in this room
      G
But I don't seem to see many bullets coming through
         Am
See many bullets coming through
Em
Metaphorically I'm the man
                      D
But literally I don't know what I'd do
     G
""I'd live for you,"" and that's hard to do
                            Am
Even harder to say when you know it's not true
     Em
Even harder to write when you know that tonight
                                      C
There were people back home who tried talking to you
         G
But then you ignored them still
                                Am
All these questions they’re for real
                   Em
Like who would you live for? Who would you die for?
                   D
And would you ever kill?

  This night is cold in the kingdom
Em               F
  I can feel you fade away
Am                        G

Don't cut me down, throw me out, leave me here to waste

I once was a man with dignity and grace
        Am                                  G
Now I'm slipping through the cracks of your cold embrace

Could you find a way to let me down slowly?

A little sympathy, I hope you can show me
       Am                       G
If you wanna go then I'll be so lonely

Am                      G

Midnight you come and pick me up, no headlights

Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style

You got the long hair slicked back, white t-shirt

Takes me home, lights are off he's taking off his coat

I say ""I heard (oh) that you've been out and about

With some other girl"" (some other girl)

You say what you heard is true but I

PUT THE CAPO ON 3 BUT KEEP THESE CHORDS SHAPES. THAT MEANS: DO NOT TOUCH THE TRANSPOSING TOOL)

Thanks to catherinet227 for the lyrics correction and mfulms21 for noting a missing G at the end of the

 [Verse 1]
C       C/B            Am
 Betty, I won’t make assumptions
      Gsus4                 F
About why you switched your homeroom
                          Gsus4
But I think it’s cause of me
C       C/B            Am
 Betty, one time I was riding
      Gsus4             F
on my skateboard when I passed your house
                     Gsus4
It’s like I couldn’t breathe
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
C             C/B          Am
You heard the rumors from Inez
            Gsus4            F
You can’t believe a word she says most times
                     Gsus4
But this time it was true
    Am          G      C    F
The worst thing that I ever did
    Am     G      F   G
was what I did to you

But if I just showed up at your party
          Am                 G
Would you have me? Would you want me?
          F             Am
Would you tell me to go fuck myself
   G
Or lead me to the garden?
       C                C/B
In the garden would you trust me
     Am               G            F
If I told you it was just a summer thing?
         Am           G
I’m only seventeen, I don’t know anything
                  C
But I know I miss you

C       C/B             Am
 Betty, I know where it all went wrong
     Gsus4             F
Your favorite song was playing
                         Gsus4
from the far side of the gym
C      C/B           Am
 I was nowhere to be found
           Gsus4
I hate the crowds you know that
F                          Gsus4
 Plus I saw you dance with him

[Bridge]
Am                    G
I was walking home on broken cobblestones
              F
Just thinking of you when she pulled up
       G
Like a figment of my worst intentions
Am                            G
She said, ""James get in let’s drive."" Those days
            F
turned into nights, slept next to her
   G                           C
But I dreamt of you all summer long

C       C/B              Am
 Betty, I’m here on your doorstep

And I planned it out for weeks now
                         Gsus4
But it’s finally sinking in
C       C/B              Am
 Betty, right now is the last time
      Gsus4            F
I can dream about what happens when
                Gsus4
You see my face again
    Am   G       C       F
The only thing I want to do
   Am      G     F    G
Is make it up to you
     C                 C/B  Am Gsus4 F  Em Gsus4
So I showed up at your party
     C                    C/B  Am Gsus4 F  Em Gsus4
Yeah, I showed up at your party

Yeah, I showed up at your party

Will you have me will you love me
         G              D/F#
Will you kiss me on the porch
            Em               A
In front of all your stupid friends?
       D                D/C#
If you kiss me, will it be
            Bm
just like I dreamed it
        A                 G
Will it patch your broken wings
         D/F#         Em            A
I’m only seventeen, I don’t know anything

But I know I miss you
 
 
[Outro]
G                 D        A G
 Standing in your cardigan
G              D         A G
 Kissing in my car again
G
Stopped at a streetlight
            D        D/F# G
you know, I miss you

Sometimes late at night
D                         C/G  G    Am/G  G
I lie awake and watch her sleeping
      D                Am7
She's lost in peaceful dreams
          D                  C                G     C/G  G
So I turn out the lights and lay there in the dark

If I never wake up in the morning

Who never knew how much I loved them

Now I live with the regret

That my true feelings for them never were revealed

To say each day how much she means to me

And avoid that circumstance
                 D                C              G   C/G  G
Where there's no second chance to tell her how I feel

                F#m7         A                       C#m7    A
Cuz I have been told that salvation lets their wings unfold.

     C              G/B              Am
If I had to live my life without you near me
    Em/G              Fmaj7    C/E
The days would all be empty
    Dm                   G
The nights would seem so long
 
     C            G/B        Am
With you I see forever oh so clearly
  Em/G               Fmaj7        C/E
I might have been in love before

But it never felt this strong
 
    Fmaj7                C/E

They'll take us where we want to go
Dm7         C

Nothing's gonna change my love for you
    G                        E7
You ought to know by now how much I love you
Am              D

You don't have to change a thing

I love you just the way you are

Song: Just the Way You Are
 
Capo 5
 
 
[Intro]
 
C Am F C
 
 
[Verse]
 
C
 Oh, her eyes, her eyes make the stars look like they're not shining
Am
 Her hair, her hair falls perfectly without her trying
F                                       C
 She's so beautiful, and I tell her every day
 
     C
Yeah, I know, I know when I compliment her she won't believe me
Am
 And it's so, it's so sad to think she don't see what I see
F                                           C
 But every time she asks me do I look okay I say
 
 
[Chorus]
 
                C                   Am
When I see your face, there's not a thing that I would change
              F                       C
Cause you're amazing, just the way you are
             C                      Am
And when you smile, the whole world stops and stares for a while
                  F                        C
Cause girl you're amazing, just the way you are
 
 
[Verse]
 
C
 Her lips, her lips I could kiss them all day if she'd let me
Am
 Her laugh, her laugh she hates but I think it's so sexy
F                                        C
 She's so beautiful, and I tell her every day
 
         C
Oh, you know, you know, you know I'd never ask you to change
   Am
If perfect is what you're searching for, then just stay the same
F                                                        C
So, don't even bother asking if you look okay, you know I say
 
 
[Chorus]
 
                C                   Am
When I see your face, there's not a thing that I would change
              F                       C
Cause you're amazing, just the way you are
             C                      Am
And when you smile, the whole world stops and stares for a while
                  F                        C
Cause girl you're amazing, just the way you are
 
            C                Am
The way you are, the way you are
            F                        C
Girl you're amazing, just the way you are
 
                C                   Am
When I see your face, there's not a thing that I would change
              F                       C
Cause you're amazing, just the way you are
             C                      Am
And when you smile, the whole world stops and stares for a while
                  F                        C
Cause girl you're amazing, just the way you are

[Verse]
C                G                      Am
  Let's dance in style, let's dance for a while
           F                            G
Heaven can wait we're only watching the skies
               Dm                      F
Hoping for the best, but expecting the worst
                       G6   Fmaj7   G6   C
Are you gonna drop the bomb or not?
 
C           G                      Am
Let us die young or let us live forever
           F                            G
We don't have the power, but we never say never
               Dm                      F
Sitting in the sandpit, life is a short trip
                        G6   Fmaj7   G6   C
The music's for the sad man
 
C                G                    Am
Can you imagine when this race is won
           F                       G
Turn our golden faces into the sun
               Dm                      F
Praising our leaders, we're getting in tune
                       G6   Fmaj7   G6   C
The music's played by the mad man
 
[Chorus]
C         G
  Forever Young
          Am         F
I want to be Forever Young
G                      Am
 Do you really want to live forever?
F       G
 Forever, and ever

     Forever Young.
 
[Verse]
C                G                      Am
Some are like water, some are like the heat
           F                         G
Some are the melody and some are the beat
               Dm                     F
Sooner or later they all will be gone
                       G6   Fmaj7   G6   C
Why don't they stay young?
 
C                G                      Am
It's so hard to get old without a cause
           F                            G
I don't want to perish like a fading horse
                 Dm              F
Youth's like diamonds in the sun
                       G6   Fmaj7   G6   C
And diamonds are forever
 
C                G                Am
So many adventures given up today
           F                    G
So many songs we forgot to play
               Dm                      F
So many dreams swinging out of the blue
                       G6   Fmaj7   G6   C
Oh let it come true
 
[Chorus]
C         G
  Forever Young
          Am         F
I want to be Forever Young
G                      Am
 Do you really want to live forever?
F       G
 Forever, and ever
C         G
  Forever Young,
          Am         F
I want to be Forever Young
G                     Am
Do you really want to live forever?
F  G         C
     Forever Young.
 
[Solo]
 
[Chorus]
C         G
  Forever Young
          Am         F
I want to be Forever Young
G                      Am
 Do you really want to live forever?
F       G
 Forever, and ever
C         G
  Forever Young,
          Am         F
I want to be Forever Young

Do you really want to live forever?

I used to believe

We were burnin' on the edge of somethin' beautiful

Somethin' beautiful
          Am
Sellin' a dream
          C                            Em   F
Smoke and mirrors keep us waitin' on a miracle
     Em   F
On a miracle
 
 
[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber]
 
     F
Say, go through the darkest of days
Am
Heaven's a heartbreak away
G                              Dm
Never let you go, never let me down
    F
Oh, it's been a hell of a ride

Driving the edge of a knife

At the wheel, we've got a million miles ahead of us

Miles ahead of us
            Am
All that we need
     C                            Em  F

View to all the critics, I decided to make some corrections to make it easier to read.
 
PRECISIONS ON CHORDS: It is hard to figure out how to name these chords with such a
tuning. So I just decided to name them according to the prominent bass note and I gave for
a number if necessary. Also, when the chord includes notes that are at 10th fret or more,
decided to put – between the strings to avoid confusion (example: D1 : 0-12-12-000). It
is really easy to play, but just have the patience to figure out with the chords. If it is
too confusing for you, take a pen and write over each chords the way to play it so you don't
have to get back to the list all the time.
 
TUNING : BDDDDD (E down to B; A down to D; D stays the same;
                 G down to D; B UP to D; E down to D)

[Verse 1]
         D3         E        G
And I’d give up forever to touch you
         B             A          G
Cause I know that you feel me somehow
            D3         E           G
You’re the closest to heaven that I’ll ever be
       B          A             G
And I don’t wanna go home right now
 
[Verse 2]
     D3          E             G
And all I could taste is this moment
     B         A               G
And all I can breathe is your life
     D3        E         G
And sooner or later it’s over
        B           A          G
I just don’t wanna miss you tonight
 
[Chorus]
       D1             D2       G
And I don’t want the world to see me
         B2              C            G
Cause I don’t think that they’d understand
     D1           D2          G

        B2          C         G

[Verse 3]
         D3             E                 G
And you can’t fight the tears that ain’t coming
        B         A             G
Or the moment of truth in your lies
     D3         E               G
When everything feels like the movies
          B             A            G
Yeah, you bleed just to know you’re alive
 
[Chorus]

And I don’t want the world to see me

Cause I don’t think that they’d understand

When everything’s made to be broken
        B2          C         G
I just want you to know who I am
 
Create your solo as you wish.

E                    Am
First, there was the one who challenged
D                 G
All my dreams and all my balance
C               B7             E
She could never be as good as you
E               Am
You could be my unintended
D                 G
Choice to live my life extended
C                 B7               E
You should be the one I'll always love

[Chorus]
E                 Am
I'll be there, as soon as I can

But I'm busy, mending all the
C              B7            E
Pieces of, the life I had before
 
E                 Am
I'll be there, as soon as I can

D       D                 F#m7
Hold me close and hold me fast,
     F#m7            G
This magic spell you cast,
     G            Em7   A7
This is La Vie En Rose
Em       Em             A7
When you kiss me Heaven sighs,

  Em7           G      D    Em7    A7
I see La Vie En Rose

D        D                F#m7
When you press me to your heart,
    F#m7        Em
I’m in a world apart,
  Em                G      G
A world where roses bloom
 
A7             A7            Em         D    D
  And when you speak, angels sing from above
Em        Em            F#m7
Every day words seem to      turn into love songs

Give your heart and soul to me,

Well good for you, I guess you moved on really easily

There's still a little bit of your face, I haven't kissed

You step a little closer each day,       that i can't say what's going on
 
 
[Chorus]

Stones taught me to fly

There's still a little bit of your song, in my ear
Em7                   Cadd9         G       G/F#
There's still a little bit of your words, I long to hear

So it's not hard to fall, when you float like a cannon...
 
G     Cadd9/G         D
Stones taught me to fly
G     Cadd9/G      D
Love taught me to cry
G                  Cadd9/G         D
So come on courage teach me to be shy
                Am7              Cadd9           D
Cause it's not hard to fall, and I don't wanna scare her

It's not hard to fall, and I don't wanna lose

We both know the day will come
    F                 C
But I don't want to leave you
 
 
[Chorus]
 
Gm                  C
I see my vision burn, 
                              F
I feel my memories fade with time
     C                Dm
But I'm too young to worry
Bb
A melody, a memory, or just one picture
 
Dm                F                   Gm
Seize the day or die regretting the time you lost
        C              Bb
It's empty and cold without you here,
          C               Dm
Too many people to ache over
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
Dm              Gm             F
Newborn life replacing all of us, 
                C            Dm
Changing this fable we live in
             Gm             F         C
No longer needed here so where do we go?
Dm         Gm                F
Will you take a journey tonight,
           C                   Dm
Follow me past the walls of death?
          Gm                F            C
But girl, what if there is no eternal life?
 
 
[Chorus]
 
Gm                C
I see my vision burn, 
                              F
I feel my memories fade with time

        C              Bb
It's empty and cold without you here,

Too many people to ache over

Trials in life, questions of us existing here,
               C            Bb
Don't want to die alone without you here

Or kiss you lips again? Wooaaahh

And the memories for us to see

[Verse 1]
 
          Am               G7/B
She keeps Moët and Chandon in her pretty cabinet.
Am                              G7/B           C
 ""Let them eat cake"", she says, just like Mary Antoinette.

A built in remedy for Khrushchev and Kennedy,

To a-void complications, she never kept the same address.
Am                    G7/B              C
 In conversation, she spoke just like a baroness.
 
C               Em          C7             F
 Met a man from China, went down to Geisha Minah,

Starry, starry  night,   paint your palette blue and grey

For they could not love you, but still your love was true
             Am                             Cm
And when no hope was left in sight on that starry, starry night,

You took your life as lovers often do

But I could have told you, Vincent, this world was

Never meant for one as beautiful as you

Frameless heads on nameless walls with eyes that watch the world and can't forget

The silver thorn of bloody rose, lie crushed and broken on the virgin snow

How you suffered for your sanity, how you tried to set them free,

[Verse]
                        C#m
I needed somewhere to hang my head
                A
Without your noose

You gave me something that I didn't have

But had no use

I was too weak to give in

Too strong to lose

My heart is under arrest again

But I break loose

My head is giving me life or death

I swear I'll never give in

       C          F             Am          G
And if you're in love, then you are the lucky one, 
       C              F             Am      G
'Cause most of us are bitter over someone.
        C          F             Am   G
Setting fire to our insides for fun,
      C                     F             Am
To distract our hearts from ever missing them.
          G                   Am
But I'm forever missing him.
 
 
[Chorus]
 
F  G                 Am
       And you caused it, 
F  G                 Am
       And you caused it, 
F  G                 Am
       And you caused it

But I'm scared to be alone

You cut out a piece of me, and now I bleed internally

Left here without you (No, no, no), without you (Ooh, ooh)

And it hurts for me to think about what life could possibly be like

And even harder to let you go, I

   Said I remember when we used to sit
C            G               Am         F
   In the government yard in Trenchtown
C               G              Am         F
  And then Georgie would make the fire lights,
         C             G                   Am      F
as it was, like a wood burnin' through the night
C                G              Am         F
   Then we would cook cornmeal porridge

  Of which I'll share with you, (oooh).
C     G          Am        F
   My feet is my only carriage

[Verse 1]
G         C/G    G                Bm              C
  An only child alone and wild, a cabinet maker's son
Am                         Em                     Am                 C    D
  His hands were meant for different work and his heart was known to none
G             C/G      G                 Bm       C
  He left his home and went his lone and solitary way
       Am            Em           Am    D7    G  C/G  G  C/G  G  C/G  G
And he gave to me a gift I know I never can repay
 
[Verse 2]
G         C/G    G        Bm             C
  A quiet man of music, denied a simpler fate
Am                 Em                   Am             C    D
  He tried to be a soldier once but his music wouldn't wait
G               C/G          G             Bm                C
  He earned his love through discipline, a thund'ring velvet hand
    Am              Em                      Am       D7   G
His gentle means of sculpting souls took me years to understand
 
[Chorus]
C                   Bm                    C                G
  The leader of the band is tired and his eyes are growing old
        Am                    Em                 Am            F  D
But his blood runs through my instrument and his song is in my so-oul
C                    Bm           C               G
  My life has been a poor attempt, to imitate the man
    Am            Em            Am     C      G   C/G  G  C/G  G  C/G  G
I'm just a living legacy to the leader of the band
 
[Verse 3]
G              C/G        G                  Bm            C
  My brothers' lives were different for they heard another call
Am             Em            Am           C    D
One went to Chicago, and the other to St. Paul
G            C/G G             Bm            C
  And I'm in Colorado when I'm not in some hotel
Am              Em               Am      D7      G  C/G  G
Living out this life I chose and come to know so well

[Verse 4]
G             C/G     G              Bm             C
  I thank you for the music and your stories of the road
Am                    Em              Am              C   D
  I thank you for the freedom when it came my time to go
G             C/G     G                Bm                 C
  I thank you for the kindness and the times when you got tough
    Am            Em              Am        D7    G
And Papa, I don't think I said ""I love you"" near enough
 
[Chorus]
C                   Bm                    C                G

Special thanks to Mikael Thunborg // Moixe for his great tab here on ultimate guitar.
 
I have added some chords in this tab.
I think the harmony of the chords Cmaj7, G6 and D/F# fits perfectly.
 
My cover of this song with exactly these chords: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4LmLEUEtMFc
 
Tuning: Standard
 
Chords:
Em     022000
C      x32010
Cmaj7  x32000
G      320033
G6     320000
D/F#   2x0232

[Verse 1]
 
Em       Cmaj7           G6               D/F#
Another head hangs lowly child is slowly taken
Em               Cmaj7               G6              D/F#
And the violence caused such silence who are we mistaken
        Em                        C
But you see it's not me, it's not my family,
        G                               D/F#
In your head, in your head, they are fighting
           Em                                   C                            G
With their tanks and their bombs and their bombs and their guns in your head,
                         D/F#
in your head, they are crying.

          C             G
Some say love, it is a river,
      F            G    C
That drowns the tender reed
          C             G
Some say love, it is a razor,
      F            G       C
That leaves your soul to bleed
          Em            Am
Some say love, it is a hunger,

An endless aching need
       C              G
I say love, it is a flower and
 F        G    C
You its only seed
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
           C                 G
It's the heart afraid of breaking
      F       G        C
That never learns to dance
           C                G
It's the dream afraid of waking

That never takes the chance
         Em                Am     Am7
It's the one who won't be taken
      F     Dm7     G
Who cannot seem to give
        C                G
And the soul afraid of dying
      F     G         C
That never learns to live
 
 
[Verse 3]
 
          C                   G
When the night has been too lonely
         F        G         C
And the road has been too long
          C                G
And you think that love is only
         F      G        C
For the lucky and the strong

Far beneath the bitter snow

Lies the seed that with the sun's love,

In the spring becomes the rose

C              Am                             Em
  You could've asked me why I broke your heart
             G
You could've told me that you fell apart
C                Am                         Em
  But you walked past me like I wasn't there
            G
And just pretended like you didn't care
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
C         Am         Em       G
  I don't know why I run away

[Verse 3]
C             Am                             Em
   I made you think that I would always stay
              G
  I said some things that I should never say
C                    Am                             Em
  Yeah, I broke your heart like someone did to mine

  And now you won't love me for a second time

Title: Don't You Remember
Artist: Adele
Album: 21 (2011)
 
Transcription by Benjamin Förster (benj@mailbox.org)
 
Capo +1
 
 
[Intro]
 
D4  D  (4x)
 
 
[Verse 1]
 
D                    G
When will I see you again?
              Bm
You left with no goodbye 
      D               G
Not a single word was said
   D             D/F#     G
No final kiss to seal any sins
      Bm             D             G
I had no idea of the state we were in
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
 
                A
I know I have a fickle heart
      A
And a bitterness
      Bm
And a wandering eye
      F#              A
And a heaviness in my head
 
 
[Chorus]
 
                D      Dmaj7  G
But don't you remember?
            Em     Asus4  A  D
Don't you remember?
    G                D  F#madd6    G
The reason you loved me          before
                 Em  Asus4  A    D
Baby please remember me     once more
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
D                                       G
When was the last time that you thought of me?
               Bm        D                  G
Or have you completely erased me from your memory?
        D           F#madd6      G
I often think about where I went wrong
           Bm  D             G
The more I do     the less I know
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
 
                A
I know I have a fickle heart
      A
And a bitterness
      Bm
And a wandering eye
      F#              A
And a heaviness in my head
 
 
[Chorus]
 
                D      Dmaj7  G
But don't you remember?
            Em     Asus4  A  D
Don't you remember?
    G                D  F#madd6    G
The reason you loved me          before
                 Em  Asus4  A    G
Baby please remember me     once more
 
 
[Bridge]
 
Bb                    F/C
Gave you the space so you could breathe
 
          C                        G
I kept my distance so you would be free
 
   Bb                       Dm
In hope that you'd find the missing piece
 
   Em                A4   A
To bring you back to me
 
 
[Chorus]
 
                E      G#madd6  A
Why don't you remember?
            F#m     Bsus4  B  E
Don't you remember?
    A                E  G#madd6    A
The reason you loved me          before
                 F#m  Bsus4  B    A
Baby please remember  me     once more
 
 
[Outro]
 
E                    A
When will I see you again?

G
Fall is here, hear the yell
G
Back to school, ring the bell
C
Brand new shoes, walking blues
G
Climb the fence, books and pens
D               C               G
I can tell that we are gonna be friends
D               C               G
I can tell that we are gonna be friends
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
G
Walk with me, Suzy Lee
G
Through the park, and by the tree
C
We will rest upon the ground
    G
and look at all the bugs we've found
D              C                 G
Safely walk to school without a sound
D              C                 G
Safely walk to school without a sound
 
 
[Verse 3]
 
G
Here we are, no one else
   G
We walked to school all by ourselves
C
There's dirt on our uniforms
     G
from chasing all the ants and worms
D               C                 G
We clean up and now it's time to learn
D               C                 G
We clean up and now it's time to learn
 
 
[Verse 4]
 
G
Numbers, letters, learn to spell
G
Nouns and books, and show and tell
C
Playtime, we will throw the ball
G
Back to class, through the hall
D                 C                   G
Teacher marks our height against the wall
D                 C                   G
Teacher marks our height against the wall
 
 
[Bridge]
 
C                          G
  And we don't notice any time pass
C                     G
  We don't notice anything
A
We sit side by side in every class
C
Teacher thinks that I sound funny
D
but she likes the way you sing
 
 
[Verse 5]
 
  G
Tonight I'll dream while I'm in bed
     G
When silly thoughts go through my head
 C
about the bugs and alphabet
    G
And when I wake tomorrow I'll bet
     D              C              G
that you and I will walk together again
D               C               G
I can tell that we are gonna be friends
     D               C               G
Yes, I can tell that we are gonna be friends

Getting myself lost

I am so gone,

So tell me the way home
                 D                    A
I listen to sad songs, singing about love
 
And where it goes wrong

A Hard Day's Night
(Lennon/McCartney)
 
From ""A Hard Day's Night"" (1964)
 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
EDIT April 2015
Went through the comments section and tried to update this tab using the corrections there
as it is one of the versions on UG that are visited frequently.
Some of the voicings are really  difficult to identify. There are several guitar tracks,
some of which might use differing voicings (maybe a 12-string, too?). Some options are
suggested below. Choose whatever sounds good to you. Moreover, there is a special suggestion
made by the original submitter of this tab. Sounds nice, even though it might not be
what is played on the Beatles' recording.
 
EDIT May 2018
Opening chord: Harrison arguably played an Fadd9 here. Playing alone on a single 6-string guitar,
however, there is no ""correct"" way to play the opening chord. What is heard on the Beatles'
recording is a blend of 6- and 12-string guitars, bass and piano(s ?). In order to recreate the
effect of this multi-layered sound impression, a G7sus4 is often suggested, which actually
sounds close. But the ""a"" is missing here. Another option may be Fadd9, but then the bass plays
""d"", so maybe D7sus4 might be a good substitute, too (not enough bottom end, though, in my opinion).
Experiment for yourself, play together with other guitarists and use different voicings in order to
create the big ""Bang!"".
 
 
CHORDS / SPECIAL VOICINGS
 
Opening Chord
             E-A-D-G-B-e
G7sus4/D     x-5-3-5-3-3  or  x-x-0-0-1-1
D7sus4       x-x-0-2-1-3 (actually Fadd9/D)
D7sus4/A     x-0-0-0-1-3 or x-0-0-2-1-3 (more bottom end than the regular D7sus4)
Fadd9        x-x-3-2-1-3 or 1-0-3-2-1-3 or 1-3-3-0-1-1 (on a 12-string this voicing
                                                        would include the high f AND g notes)
F6add9/A     x-0-3-5-3-3
F6add9/C     x-3-3-2-3-3
(==> all voicings of Fadd9 or F6add9 miss out on the ""d"" in the bass, though)
 
Another opening chord idea (using a different tuning)
             D-G-D-G-B-e
Fadd9/D      0-0-3-2-1-3
 
Song
             E-A-D-G-B-e
Keep your pinky on the third fret of the high e-string for the first two lines of the verses
for the G, C, and F chords
G            3-x-0-0-3-3
C            x-3-2-0-1-3
F            x-x-3-2-1-3 or 1-x-3-2-1-3 (actually Fadd9)
 
D            x-x-0-2-3-2
Bm           x-2-4-4-3-2
Em           0-2-2-0-0-0
C6           x-3-2-2-1-0
D7sus4       x-x-0-2-1-3 (actually Fadd9/D)
Dm7          x-x-0-2-1-1 (actually F/D)
 
Another possibility which gives a special flavour in the verses is G - Cadd9 - F6add9.
This is very easy to play; leave your pinky and ring finger in position.
G            3-x-0-0-3-3
Cadd9        x-3-2-0-3-3
F6add9       x-x-3-2-3-3

                   C                              Em
The way that she's whispering, the way that she's pulling you in
                 F                         G
Lord knows I've tried, I can't get her off my mind
 
[Chorus]

I want to taste her lips, yeah cause they taste like you
           C                          G
I want to drown myself in a bottle of her perfume
           Am                           F
I want her long blonde hair, I want her magic touch
            C                        G
Yeah, cause maybe then you'd want me just as much

is a holy grail I've got to find
     G                          Am

Capo 1
 
 
[Verse]
 
Em                                      C
The snow glows white on the mountain tonight
D                       Am
Not a footprint to be seen
Em              C              D                      Am
A kingdom of isolation, and it looks like I'm the Queen
Em      C                      D              Am
The wind is howling like this swirling storm inside
Em                 D                  A
Couldn't keep it in; Heaven knows I've tried
D                                    C
Don't let them in, don't let them see
                                      D
Be the good girl you always have to be
                                     C
Conceal, don't feel, don't let them know
C
Well now they know
 
 
[Chorus]
 
        G       D
Let it go, let it go
Em                      C
Can't hold it back any more
G               D
Let it go, let it go
Em                      C
Turn away and slam the door
G               D
I don't care
Em                      C
What they're going to say
Bm              Bb             C
Let the storm rage on, the cold never bothered me anyway
 
 
[Instrumental]
 
G       D
 
 
[Verse]
 
Em                      C
It's funny how some distance
D                       Am
Makes everything seem small
Em                              D
And the fears that once controlled me
A
Can't get to me at all
D                               C
It's time to see what I can do
                                D
To test the limits and break through
C
No right, no wrong, no rules for me
C
I'm free
 
 
[Chorus]
 
G               D
Let it go, let it go
Em                              C
I am one with the wind and sky
G               D
Let it go, let it go
Em              C
You'll never see me cry
G         D
Here I stand
Em      C
And here I stay
Bm              Bb
Let the storm rage on
 
 
[Bridge]
 
 C
My power flurries through the air into the ground
 C
My soul is spiraling in frozen fractals all around
D
And one thought crystallizes like an icy blast
E            C              D               Am C
  I'm never going back, the past is in the past
 
 
[Chorus]
 
        G               D
Let it go, let it go
Em                              C
When I'll rise like the break of dawn
G               D
Let it go, let it go
Em                      C
That perfect girl is gone
 
G         D        Em         C   C#m
Here I stand in the light of day
B                Bb
Let the storm rage on,
C
The cold never bothered me anyway

               G                        Bm
Isusuko na ang sandata aatras na sa laban
            C                        G      D/F#
Di dahil naduduwag kundi dahil mahal kita
             G                     Bm
Mahirap nang labanan mga espada ng orasan
          C                           G   D/F#
Kung pipilitin pa, lalo lang masasaktan
 
[Pre-Chorus]
   Cadd9                        G  D/F#
Mangangarap hanggang sa pagbalik
Am                  C/B     Cadd9           D
Mangangarap pa rin kahit masakit
 
[Chorus]
        G               Bm
Baka sakaling makita kitang muli
            C                     G    D/F#
Pagsikat ng araw, paglipas ng gabi
             G                    Bm
Kung di pipilitin ang di pa para sa'kin
       C              G  D/F#
Baka sakaling maibalik

[Verse 1]
 
Em
She was more like a beauty queen from a movie screen
                                                 Am
I said don't mind, but what do you mean I am the one
                                   Em
Who will dance on the floor in the round
                  Am                                      Em
She said I am the one, who will dance on the floor in the round
 
She told me her name was Billie Jean, as she caused a scene
                                                           Am
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one
                                   Em
Who will dance on the floor in the round
 
 
[Bridge]
 
C                        Em
People always told me be careful of what you do
      C                               Em
Don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
    C                      Em
And mama always told me be careful of who you love
       C                                 B7
And be careful of what you do before the lie becomes the truth
 
 
[Chorus]
 
Em     Am      Em     Gadd9/E Em
Billie Jean is not my lover
             Am       Em                 Am  Bmadd11/A
She's just a girl who says that I am the one
        Gadd11/A   Bm7/A    Em
But the kid is     not   my son
                  Am
She says I am the one
        Gadd11/A   Bm7/A    Em
But the kid is     not   my son
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
Em
For forty days and for forty nights. The law was on her side
                                                        Am
But who can stand when she's in demand. Her schemes and plans
                                     Em
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round
                    Am                             Em
So take my strong advice, remember to always think twice
(Do think twice)
 
 
[Verse 3]
 
Em
She told my baby we'd danced till three, then she looked at me
                                                     Am
Then showed a photo my baby cried his eyes were like mine
                                     Em
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round
 
 
[Bridge]
 
C                        Em
People always told me be careful of what you do
      C                               Em
Don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
         C                      Em
Then she stood right by me. The smell of sweet perfume
     C                           B7
This happened much too soon. She called me to her room
 
 
[Chorus]
 
Em     Am      Em     Gadd9/E Em
Billie Jean is not my lover
             Am       Em                 Am  Bmadd11/A
She's just a girl who says that I am the one
        Gadd11/A   Bm7/A    Em
But the kid is     not   my son
                  Am
She says I am the one
        Gadd11/A   Bm7/A    Em
But the kid is     not   my son
                    Am                             Em
So take my strong advice, remember to always think twice

[Intro]
G5/D
D5     G5/D x4
 
[Verse 1]
D                         C
 When I walk beside her I am the better man
G                                  D
 When I look to leave her I always   stagger back again
D                                       C
 Once I built an ivory tower so I could   worship from above
      G                            D
When I climbed down to be set free   she took me in again
 
[Chorus]
          D             Am
There's a big, a big hard sun
                   G                      D
Beatin' on the big people in the big hard world
 
[Verse 2]
D                                  C
 When she comes to greet me she is   mercy at my feet
G                                     D
 When I see her bitter charm she just   throws it back at me
D                             C
 Once I dug an early grave to find a better land
G                                               D
 She just smiled and laughed at me and took her blues back again
 
[Chorus]
          D             Am
There's a big, a big hard sun
                   G                      D
Beatin' on the big people in the big hard world

[Verse 3]
D                                     C
 When I go to cross that river she is   comfort by my side
G                                  D                    G5/D
 When I try to understand she just   opens up her hands

D5     G5/D x2
 
[Verse 4]
D                                C
 Once I stood to lose her when I   saw what I had done
G                                           D
 Bound down and threw away the hours of her   garden and her sun
D                          C
 So I tried to warn her, I turned to see her weep
G                               D
 40 days and 40 nights and it's still coming down on me
 
[Chorus]

There's a big, a big hard sun

During the Bridge the piano plays something like this......
e|-------------------------------------------------------|
B|--4--3-----4--3-------4--------------------------------|
G|--3--3--5--3--3--5----3-----almost impossible to play--|
D|--5--5--5--5--5--5----5--------------------------------|
A|--6----------------------------------------------------|
E|-----------3----------1--------------------------------|
 
As you can see, it's nearly impssible to play on guitar when the bass note goes down to F,
so I just play the chords: Eb  Gm  F  Bb
 
I know it ain't easy giving up your heart
I know it ain't easy giving up your heart
Nobody's pefect
(I know it ain't easy giving up your heart)
Trust me I've learned it
Nobody's pefect
(I know it ain't easy giving up your heart)
Trust me I've learned it
Nobody's pefect
(I know it ain't easy giving up your heart)
Trust me I've learned it
Nobody's pefect                        C
(I know it ain't easy giving up your heart) 
Trust me I've learned it

I dare you to let me be your  your one and only

So come on and give me a chance 
                  Dm     Dm7  Dm
To prove I am the one who can
            Am   Am*  Am
walk that mile 
           Bb  Am  Gm  C
Until the end starts 
 
Come on and give me a chance
To prove I am the one who can walk that mile
Until the end starts.

Why'd you only call me when you're high?

High, why'd you only call me when you're high?

Em                C                    Am
  It's harder and harder to get you to listen, more I get through the gears
Em             C              Am                  (pause)
  Incapable of making alright decisions and having bad ideas
 
[Chorus]
Em    C                 Am
  Now it's three in the morning
                              Em
And I'm trying to change your mind
          C              Am
Left you multiple missed calls
                         Em
And to my message, you reply
C                                  Am
Why'd you only call me when you're high?
Em    C                                  Am
High, why'd you only call me when you're high?
 
[Bridge]
C             Em                              Am
  And I can't see you here, wondering where I might
C          Em                            Am
  It sorta feels like I'm running out of time
C           Em                         Am
  I haven't found what I was hoping to find
C                    B*
  You said you gotta be up in the morning, gonna have an early night
    B*
And you're starting to bore me, baby, why'd you only call me when you're high?
 
[Bridge]

[Outro]

Why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?
          C                              Em
Why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?
          C                             Em
Why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?

Why'd you only ever phone me when you're

E                       D
Please allow me to introduce myself
      A                 E
I'm a man of wealth and taste
E                      D
I've been around for a long, long year
A                           E
Stole many a man's soul and faith
 
E                     D
And I was 'round when Jesus Christ
        A                   E
Had his moment of doubt and pain
                    D
Made damn sure that Pilate
           A                    E
Washed his hands and sealed his fate
 
B
 Pleased to meet you
                  E
Hope you guess my name
           B
But what's puzzling you
                    E
Is the nature of my game
 
E                  D
I stuck around St. Petersburg
       A                       E
When I saw it was a time for a change
                        D
Killed the Czar and his ministers
    A                 E
Anastasia screamed in vain
 
  E
I rode a tank
       D
Held a general's rank
         A
When the Blitzkrieg raged
        E
And the bodies stank
 
B
 Pleased to meet you
                  E
Hope you guess my name
           B
But what's puzzling you
                    E
Is the nature of my game
  E
I watched with glee
           D
While your kings and queens
           A
Fought for ten decades
        E
For the Gods they made
 
  E
I shouted out
                D
""Who killed the Kennedys?""
     A
When after all
       E
It was you and me
 
E                  D
Let me please introduce myself
      A                 E
I'm a man of wealth and taste
                     D
And I laid traps for troubadours
        A                             E
Who get killed before they reached Bombay
 
B
 Pleased to meet you

        E              D
Just as every cop is a criminal
    A               E
And all the sinners saints
 
As heads is tails
             D
Just call me Lucifer
              A              E
'Cause I'm in need of some restraint
 
E
So if you meet me
          D
Have some courtesy

Have some sympathy, and some taste

Don't be discouraged

It's hard to take courage

In a world full of people

You call me up

C                   D  Em
What's the point of anything?
 
 
[Chorus]
C         D           G  D     Em
All of my friends are missing again
C                   D                Em
That's what happens when you fall in love
    C              D         G          D     Em
You don't have the time, you leave them all behind
    C                  D                    Em
You tell yourself it's fine, you're just in love
 
 
[Verse 2]
G                    G/F#       Em
Don't know where you are right now
C              D    Em
Did you see me on TV?
G               G/F#     Em
I'll try not to starve myself
C                   D      Em
Just because you're mad at me
    G            G/F#        Em
And I'll be in denial for at least a little while
C              D        Em
What about the plans we made?
    G               G/F#          Em
The internet's gone wild watching movie stars on trial
              C           D      Em
While they're overturning Roe v. Wade
 
 
[Chorus]
    C         D           G  D     Em
Now all of my friends are missing again
       C                   D                Em
'Cause that's what happens when you fall in love
    C              D         G          D     Em
You don't have the time, you leave them all behind
        C                  D                    Em
And you tell yourself it's fine, you're just in love
      C          D         G D Em
And I don't get along with a-nyone
C      D               Em
 Maybe I'm the problem
      C  D    Em
Maybe I'm the problem
 
 
[Outro]
C        D        Em
Maybe I, maybe I, maybe I'm the problem
C        D        Em
Maybe I, maybe I, maybe I'm the problem
C        D        Em
Maybe I, maybe I, maybe I'm the problem
C        D        Em
Maybe I, maybe I, maybe I'm the problem
C        D        Em
Maybe I, maybe I, maybe I'm the problem

Maybe I, maybe I, maybe I'm the problem

It's very different compared to the original - to understand where the song is
going, you should listen to her acoustic performance.
 
One more thing -
the lyrics are just a little different at the end, so I included those as well. :)

We're a thousand miles from comfort, we have traveled land and sea

But as long as you are with me, there's no place I rather be
Em     D     C      G Em     D        C            G
I would wait forever, exulted in the scene

As long as I am with you, my heart continues to beat
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
 
Em                        D/F#
With every step we take, Kyoto to The Bay
G               Am
Strolling so casually
Em                        D/F#
We're different and the same, gave you another name

It's a shot in the dark but I'll make it

Make it everlasting so nothing's incomplete

[Verse 1]
 
Am                           F
Pistol shots ring out in the barroom night
Am                             F
Enter Patty Valentine from the upper hall
Am                            F
  She sees the bartender in a pool of blood
Am                      F
 Cries out ""My God they killed them all!""
 
C                             F         G
  Here comes the story of the Hurricane
C                         F
  The man the authorities came to blame
Dm                            C
  For something that he never done
Dm                         C
  Put in a prison cell but one time 
              Am       F               C      G
He could have been the champion of the world

[Verse 2]
 
Am                              F
  Three bodies lyin’ there does Patty see
     Am                              F
And another man named Bello, movin’ around mysteriously
Am                                  F
  “I didn’t do it,” he says, and he throws up his hands
       Am                           F
“I was only robbin’ the register, I hope you understand
C   N.C.                  F    N.C.          G
  I saw them leavin’,” he says, and he stops
C  N.C.                   F  N.C.
  “One of us had better call up the cops”
Dm                       C
  And so Patty calls the cops
Dm                       C                Em         Am
  And they arrive on the scene with their red lights flashin’
       F              C      G
In the hot New Jersey night

Am                      F
Meanwhile, far away in another part of town
      Am                     F
Rubin Carter and a couple of friends are drivin’ around
Am                           F
Number one contender for the middleweight crown
    Am                           F
Had no idea what kinda shit was about to go down
C  N.C.                             F  N.C.           G
  When a cop pulled him over to the side of the road
C  N.C.                             F  N.C.
  Just like the time before and the time before that
   Dm                                  C
In Paterson that’s just the way things go
       Dm                         C        Em        Am
If you’re black you might as well not show up on the street
          F              C     G
’Less you wanna draw the heat

[Verse 4]
 
       Am                               F
Alfred Bello had a partner and he had a rap for the cops
        Am                                  F
Him and Arthur Dexter Bradley were just out prowlin’ around
   Am                                     F
He said, “I saw two men runnin’ out, they looked like middleweights
Am                           F
Jumped into a white car with out-of-state plates”
C  N.C.                         F  N.C.          G
  And Miss Patty Valentine just nodded her head
C   N.C.                        F   N.C.
Cop said, “Wait a minute, boys, this one’s not dead”
        Dm                      C
So they took him to the infirmary
Dm                                 C
  And though this man could hardly see
     Em                Am     F            C    G
They told him he could identify the guilty men

Am                             F
  Four in the mornin’ and they haul Rubin in
     Am                                F
They took him to the hospital and they brought him upstairs
    Am                               F
The wounded man looks up through his one dyin’ eye
      Am                                   F
""Say, why’d you bring him in here for?  He ain’t the guy!”
C  N.C.                        F  N.C.    G
  Yes, here’s the story of the Hurricane
C  N.C.                   F  N.C.
  The man the authorities came to blame

Am                       F
  Four months later, the ghettos are in flame
Am                       F
Rubin’s in South America fightin’ for his name
      Am                                   F
While Arthur Dexter Bradley’s still in the robbery game
        Am                                             F
And the cops are puttin’ the screws to him lookin’ for somebody to blame
C  N.C.                      F  N.C.             G
  “Remember that murder that happened in a bar?
C  N.C.                         F  N.C.
  Remember you said you saw the getaway car?
    Dm                                     C
You think you’d like to play ball with the law?
Dm                                          C   Em           Am
Think it might-a been that fighter that you saw runnin’ that night?
         F                C        G
Don’t forget that you are white.”

Am                               F
Arthur Dexter Bradley said, “I’m really not sure”
    Am                                   F
The cop said, “A poor boy like you could use a break
   Am                                  F
We got you for the motel job and we’re talkin’ to your friend Bello
Am                                       F
You don’t wanta have to go back to jail, be a nice fellow
C  N.C.                     F  N.C.  G
  You’ll be doin’ society a favor

  That sonofabitch is brave and gettin’ braver
Dm                           C
  We want to put his ass in stir
Dm                           C  Em     Am

[Verse 8]
 
Am                              F
Rubin could take a man out with just one punch
       Am                              F
But he never did like to talk about it all that much
        Am                F
It’s my work, he’d say, I do it for pay
    Am                         F
And when it’s over I’d just as soon go on my way
C  N.C.      F  N.C.   G
  Up to some paradise
C  N.C.                                F  N.C.
  Where the trout streams flow and the air is nice
Dm                         C
  And ride a horse along a trail
Dm                              C   Em
  But then they took him to the jailhouse
           Am            F          C      G
Where they try to turn a man into a mouse
 
 
[Instrumental]

[Verse 9]
 
Am                        F
All of Rubin’s cards were marked in advance
    Am                         F
The trial was a pig-circus, he never had a chance
    Am                           F
The judge made Rubin’s witnesses drunkards from the slums
       Am                               F
To the white folks who watched he was a revolutionary bum
C  N.C.                                F  N.C.       G
  And to the black folks he was just a crazy nigger
C  N.C.                  F  N.C.
  No one doubted that he pulled the trigger
Dm                                      C
  And though they could not produce the gun
    Dm                   C       Em      Am
The D.A. said he was the one who did the deed
        F               C      G
And the all-white jury agreed
 
 
[Instrumental]

[Verse 10]
 
Am                 F
  Rubin Carter was falsely tried
    Am                       F
The crime was murder “one.”  Guess who testified?
Am                           F
  Bello and Bradley and they both baldly lied
Am                             F
And the papers, they all went along for the ride
C  N.C.               F  N.C.     G
  How can the life of such a man
C  N.C.             F  N.C.
  Be in the palm of some fool’s hand?
Dm                     C
  To see him obviously framed
Dm                                C         Em        Am
  Couldn’t help but make me feel ashamed to live in a land
      F            C     G
Where justice is a game
 
 
[Instrumental]
 
| Am | F | Am | F |
 
 
[Verse 11]
 
    Am                         F
Now all the criminals in their coats and their ties
    Am                         F
Are free to drink martinis and watch the sun rise
      Am                          F
While Rubin sits like Buddha in a ten-foot cell
   Am                F
An innocent man in a living hell
C  N.C.                        F  N.C.    G
  Yes, that’s the story of the Hurricane
C  N.C.                          F  N.C.
  But it won’t be over till they clear his name
Dm                              C
And give him back the time he’s done
Dm                          C   Em              Am
  Put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been
    F               C      G
The champion of the world

[Verse 1]
 
  E
I met her in a club down in old Soho
          A                      D                     E
where you drink champagne and it tastes just like Coca Cola (or cherry cola)
         A   Asus4 A
C-O-L-A, cola
    E
She walked up to me and she asked me to dance
  A                           D                         E
I asked her her name and in a dark brown voice she said Lola
         A    D             C   C  D  E
L-O-L-A, Lola,  Lo lo lo lo lola
 
[Verse 2]
 
     E
Well I'm not the worlds most physical guy
             A
but when she squeezed me tight
           D                     E
she nearly broke my spine, oh my Lola
            A   Asus4 A
Lo lo lo lo Lola
 
[Verse 3]
 
     E
Well I'm not dumb but I can't understand
        A                       D
why she walked like a woman and talked like a man
      E
oh my Lola

[Chorus 1]
 
        B7 ***
Well we drank champagne and danced all night

under electric candlelight
    A
She picked me up and sat me on her knee
 
and said 'Dear boy, won't you come home with me'
 
[Verse 4]
 
     E
Well I'm not the world's most passionate guy
           A                         D                  E

I fell to the floor

I got down on my knees

Then I looked at her and she at me

Well that's the way that I want it to stay

Girls will be boys and boys will be girls
       A                     D                         E
It's a mixed up, muddled up, shook up world except for Lola
            A
Lo lo lo lo Lola
 
[Chorus 2]
 
       B7
Well I left home just a week before
    F#
And I'd never ever kissed a woman before
A
Lola smiled and took me by the hand
 
and said 'dear boy, I'm gonna make you a man'
 
[Verse 6]
 
     E
Well I'm not the worlds most masculine man
      A                      D

I realized quickly when I knew I should

Yeah we might die from medication but we sure killed all the pain
         Am            C               Am        D        G
What was normal in the evening, by the morning, seems insane
 
 
[Chorus]
         C                                    G
And I'm not sure what the trouble was, that started all of this
      C                                  G      A7
The reasons all have run away, but the feeling never did
     C                      Em              G     D           C
It's not something I would recommend but it is one way to live
               Am            C                 Am       D      G
'Cause what is simple in the moonlight, by the morning, never is
 
              Am           C                  Am      D     Em
Yeah it was simple in the moonlight, now it's so complicated
 
           Am            C             Am            C            Am
It was so simple in the moonlight, so simple in the moonlight, so simple in
    C          G
the moonlight...

And I crash and I break down

Your words in my head, knives in my heart

Your words in my head, knives in my heart

[Intro]

Em    C  G
 
[Chorus]
                       Em
Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky
             C            G
Are like shooting stars
                      Em                             C              G
I could really use a wish right now (wish right now, wish right now)
                       Em
Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky
             C            G
Are like shooting stars
                      Em                             C              G
I could really use a wish right now (wish right now, wish right now)
 
[Verse 1]
      Em
Yeah! I could use a dream or a genie or a wish
   C                  G
To go back to a place much simpler than this
      Em
Cause after all the partyin’ and smashin’ and crashin’
C                  G
 And all the glitz and the glam and the fashion
Em
   And all the pandemonium and all the madness
C                      G
  There comes a time when you fade to the blackness
Em
  And when you’re staring at that phone in your lap
        C                      G
And you hopin' but them people never call you back
 
Em
  But that’s just how the story unfolds
    C                G
You get another hand soon after you fold
Em
   And when your plans unravel in the sand
           C            G
What would you wish for if you had one chance?
 
   Em
So airplane, airplane, sorry I'm late
    C            G
I'm on my way so don't close that gate
   Em
If I don’t make that then I’ll switch my flight
             C
And I’ll be right back at it by the end of the night
 
[Chorus]
                       Em
Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky
             C            G
Are like shooting stars
                      Em                             C              G
I could really use a wish right now (wish right now, wish right now)
                       Em
Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky
             C            G
Are like shooting stars
                      Em                             C              G
I could really use a wish right now (wish right now, wish right now)
 
[Verse 2]
         Em
Somebody take me back to the days
                  C             G
Before this was a job, before I got paid
               Em
Before it ever mattered what I had in my bank
                     C                   G
Yeah back when I was tryin’ to get a tip at subway
 
                    Em
And back when I was rappin’ for the hell of it
                  C                    G
But now a days we rappin’ to stay relevant
                            Em
I’m guessin that if we can make some wishes outta airplanes
              C                  G
Then maybe yo maybe I’ll go back to the days
 
             Em
Before the politics that we call the rap game
                      C                   G
And back when ain’t nobody listened to my mix tape
                  Em
And back before I tried to cover up my slang
                     C               G
But this is for the hater, what's up Bobby Ray
 
               Em
So can I get a wish to end the politics
                    C                  G
And get back to the music that started this shit
           Em
So here I stand and then again I say
                  C
I’m hopin’ we can make some wishes outta' airplanes
 
[Chorus]
                       Em
Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky
             C            G
Are like shooting stars
                      Em                             C              G
I could really use a wish right now (wish right now, wish right now)
                       Em
Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky
             C            G
Are like shooting stars
                      Em                             C              G
I could really use a wish right now (wish right now, wish right now)
 
[Outro]
Em
   I could really use a wish right now... (oh)
C   G
      I.. I...
Em
   I could really use a wish right now (right now)
C G
    like.. like..
Em
   like shooting stars...  (oh)

[Intro]
D  C  G    x4
 
[Verse 1]
       D  C                   G
It was 1989, my thoughts were short, my hair was long
D                  C               G
Caught somewhere between a boy and man
D        C             G
She was 17 and she was far from in between
       D             C        G
It was summertime in Northern Michigan
 
[Instrumental]
D  C  G    x2
 
[Verse 2]
D                     C         G
Splashin' through the sandbar, talkin' by the campfire
          D                C                  G
It's the simple things in life like when and where
    D             C             G
We didn't have no internet, but man, I never will forget
    D                 C               G
The way the moonlight shined upon her hair
 
[Chorus]
            D                C                  G
And we were tryin' different things and we were smokin' funny things
       D               C                    G
Makin' love out by the lake to our favorite songs
        D              C           G
Sippin' whisky out the bottle, not thinkin' 'bout tomorrow
        D             C        G            D  C  G
Singin' Sweet Home Alabama all summer long
        D             C        G
Singin' Sweet Home Alabama all summer long
 
[Verse 3]
         D                C                  G
Catchin' walleye from the dock, watchin' the waves roll off the rocks
          D             C             G
She'll forever hold a spot inside my soul
      D             C                G
We'd blister in the sun, we couldn't wait for night to come
   D                 C                  G
To hit that sand and play some rock and roll
 
[Chorus]
              D                C                  G
While we were tryin' different things and we were smokin' funny things
       D               C                    G
Makin' love out by the lake to our favorite songs
        D              C           G
Sippin' whisky out the bottle, not thinkin' 'bout tomorrow
        D             C        G            D  C  G
Singin' Sweet Home Alabama all summer long
        D             C        G
Singin' Sweet Home Alabama all summer long

[Verse 4]
    D                C                   G
Now nothin' seems as strange as when the leaves began to change
   D                    C                G
Or how we thought those days would never end
    D                 C             G
Sometimes I hear that song and I'll start to sing along
          D                C              G
And think man, I'd love to see that girl again
 
[Chorus]
            D                C                  G
And we were tryin' different things and we were smokin' funny things

Singin' Sweet Home Alabama all summer long
 
        D                C                  G
We were tryin' different things and we were smokin' funny things

Singin' Sweet Home Alabama all summer long
        D             C        G
Singin' Sweet Home Alabama all summer long

Singin' Sweet Home Alabama all summer long

Leonard Cohen
 
 
[Verse 1]
 
  C          C/B    Am
I heard there was a secret chord      
     C            C/B    Am
that David played and it pleased the Lord
    F                G              C    G
But you don't really care for music do ya
   C                  F          G
It goes like this the fourth the fifth
    Am                 F
the minor fall and the major lift
    G                E          Am
The baffled king composing hallelujah
     F           Am          F           C G C  G
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
     C                C/B     Am
Your faith was strong but you needed proof
    C       C/B     Am
You saw her bathing on the roof
    F              G              C      G
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew ya
    C             F       G
She tied you to a kitchen chair
    Am                         F
She broke your throne, and she cut your hair
    G                  E             Am
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah
      F          Am           F          C G C  G
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah
 
 
[Verse 3]
 
C          C/B  Am
Maybe I've been here before
  C              C/B Am
I know this room Ive walked this floor
  F              G            C       G
I used to live alone before I knew you
     C                     F      G
I've seen your flag on the marble arch
    Am            F
But Love is not a victory march
       G               E           Am
It’s a cold and it’s a broken hallelujah
     F           Am           F          C G C  G
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah
 
 
[Verse 4]
 
      C          C/B Am
There was a time you let me know
       C        C/B   Am
What's real and going on below
    F             G             C     G
But now you never show it to me do you?
     C            F        G
I remember when I moved in you
    Am            F
The holy dark was moving too
    G               E             Am
And every breath we drew was hallelujah
     F           Am          F           C G C  G
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah
 
 
[Verse 5]
 
C          C/B  Am
Maybe there’s a God above
    C     C/B  Am
But all I ever learned from love
    F               G               C      G
Was how to shoot at someone who outdrew you
    C                    F       G
Its not the cry that you hear at night
     Am                F
It's not someone who's seen the light
       G               E           Am
It’s a cold and it’s a broken hallelujah
     F           Am          F           C G C  G
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah
 
 
[Verse 6]
 
    C          C/B Am
You say I took the name in vain
    C       C/B  Am
But I don't even know the name
    F              G                 C     G
But if I did, well really, what's it to ya?
          C                 F     G
There's a blaze of light in every word
   Am              F
It doesn't matter which you heard
    G           E           Am
The holy or the broken Hallelujah
     F           Am          F           C G C  G
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah
 
 
[Verse 7]
 
  C          C/B  Am
I did my best, it wasn't much
  C              C/B  Am
I couldn't feel, so I tried to touch
     F                 G              C      G
I've told the truth, I didn't come to fool ya
    C              F        G
And even though it all went wrong
     Am               F
I'll stand before the Lord of Song
     G             E               Am
With nothing on my tongue but Hallelujah
 
 
[Outro]
 
     F           Am          F            C G
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelu
     F           Am          F            C G
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelu
     F           Am          F            C G
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelu

There's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold

And she's buying the stairway to heaven.  (slide from open A,8th then 7th)

When she gets there she knows, if the stores are all closed 
       Fmaj7                     G    Am
With a word she can get what she came for. 
C D   Fmaj7  Am         C          G           Dsus4 D
Ooh,  ooh,    and she's buying the stairway to heaven.

There's a sign on the wall but she wants to be sure

'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings. 
     Am          Cmaj7/G#          C/G          D/F#
In a tree by the brook, there's a songbird who sings, 
          Fmaj7                      G  Am                Am7

There's a feeling I get when I look to the west, 
       C         G/B        Fmaj7 Am
And my spirit is crying for leaving. 
      C               G/B           Am
In my thoughts I have seen rings of smoke through the trees, 
        C         G/B             Fmaj7 Am     C G/B  Am7
And the voices of those who stand looking.

[Verse]
 
         C              G/B         Am
And it's whispered that soon if we all call the tune 
          C         G/B        Fmaj7 Am
Then the piper will lead us to reason. 
      C            G/B      Am
And a new day will dawn for those who stand long 
        C            G/B       Fmaj7 Am      C G/B Am7  Dsus4 D  Em/D D C/D D
And the forests will echo with laughter. 
 
C            G/B                 Am
If there's a bustle in your hedgerow, don't be alarmed now, 
C           G/B                  Fmaj7 Am
It's just a spring clean for the May  queen. 
C               G/B              Am
Yes, there are two paths you can go by, but in the long run 
C                 G/B                Fmaj7 Am          C G/B  Am7 Dsus4 D
and there's still time to change the road you're on. 
 
 
[Chorus]
 
             Am7         Em/D D C/D D Am7 Dsus4 D
And it makes me wonder,

oh. 
 
 
[Verse]
 
C             G/B           Am
Your head is humming and it won't go, in case you don't know, 
C            G/B           Fmaj7 Am
The piper's calling you to join him, 
C          G/B              Am
Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow, and did you know 
C             G/B         Fmaj7  Am
Your stairway lies on the whispering wind?

D                                       A
  I've been sitting here staring at the clock on the wall
D                                    A
  And I've been laying here praying, praying she won't call
           Em
It's just another call from home
       G                              D     A
You’ll get it and be gone and I'll be crying

  I'll be begging you baby, beg you not to leave
D                                     A
  But I'll be left here waiting' with my heart on my sleeve

Oh for the next time we'll be here
      G                                     D      A
Seems like a million years, and I think I'm dying
 
[Pre-Chorus]

  What do I have to do to make you see
Em          G             A
  She can't love you like me

Why don't you stay

I'm down on my knees

I'm so tired of being lonely

Don't I give you what you need
          A#dim         Bm
When she calls you to go
                   A          G
There's one thing you should know
                  D/F#     Em   G

  You keep telling me baby there will come a time

  When you will leave her arms and forever be in mine

But my will is getting stronger

And I think I know just what I have to do

I can't waste another minute

After all that I've put in it

I've given you my best

Why does she get the best of you

So next time you find

You want to leave her bed for mine

When she begs you not to go

I bet you think that's pretty clever don't you boy

Flying on your motorcycle
Asus2                              E    Esus4  E

Kill yourself to never ever stop

Strangers making the most of the dark

I'd love if you checked out my Youtube channel: kenempa :)
 
Enjoy!
 
Note: Fairly confident that this song is tuned at 432Hz in D# Minor, as opposed to the typical 440Hz.
Relative to 440Hz, this is about 32 cents flat in D# Minor.

Realize how much I need you
 
 
[Chorus]
 
  Em
I hate you I love you
  D
I hate that I love you
      Bm
Don't want to, but I can't put
  C
Nobody else above you
  Em
I hate you I love you
  D
I hate that I want you
    Bm
You want her, you need her
    C
And I'll never be her
 
 
[Verse]
 
  Em
I miss you when I can't sleep
   D
Or right after coffee, or right when I can't eat
  Bm
I miss you in my front seat
          C
Still got sand in my sweaters, from nights we don't remember
Em
  Do you miss me like I miss you?
D
  Fucked around and got attached to you
Bm
  Friends can break your heart too, and
C
I'm always tired but never of you
Em
If I pulled a you on you, you wouldn't like that shit
D
I put this real out, but you wouldn't bite that shit
Bm
I type a text but then I never mind that shit
C
I got these feelings but you never mind that shit
Em
Oh oh, keep it on the low
       D
You're still in love with me but your friends don't know
Bm
If you wanted me you would just say so
    C
And if I were you, I would never let me go
Em
I don't mean no harm
       D
I just miss you on my arm
        Bm
Wedding bells were just alarms
        C
Caution tape around my heart
Em
  You ever wonder what we coulda been?
D
  You said you wouldn't and you fucking did
Bm
  Lie to me, lie with me, get your fucking fix
C
  Now all my drinks and all my feelings are all fucking mixed
Em
Always missing people that I shouldn't be missing
              D
Sometimes you gotta burn some bridges just to create some distance
            Bm
I know that I control my thoughts, and I should stop reminiscing 
      C
But I learned from my dad that it's good to have feelings
     Em
When love and trust are gone
 
I guess this is moving on
Bm
Everyone I do right does me wrong
   C
So every lonely night, I sing this song
 
 
[Chorus]
 
  Em
I hate you I love you
  D
I hate that I love you
      Bm
Don't want to, but I can't put
  C
Nobody else above you
  Em
I hate you I love you
  D
I hate that I want you
    Bm
You want her, you need her
    C
And I'll never be her
 
 
[Verse]
 
Em                           D
All alone I watch you watch her
               Bm                        C
Like she's the only girl you've ever seen
Em                          D
You don't care you never did
Bm                         C
You don't give a damn about me
      Em                          D
Yeah all alone I watch you watch her
          Bm                         C
She's the only thing you've ever seen
Em                     D
How is it you never notice
     Bm                       C
That you are slowly killing me
 
 
[Chorus]
 
  Em
I hate you I love you
  D
I hate that I love you
      Bm
Don't want to, but I can't put
  C
Nobody else above you
  Em
I hate you I love you
  D
I hate that I want you

You want her, you need her
    C
And I'll never be her

[Verse 2]
                          C               Am
Ever since I left the city, you, you, you
                         Em
You and me we just don't get along
                        C             Am
You make me feel like I did you wrong
                         Em
Going places where you don't belong
                           C      Am
Ever since I left the city, you
                          Em
You got exactly what you asked for
                               C       Am
Running out of pages in your passport
                                    Em
Hanging with some girls I've never seen before
 
 
[Hook]
                          C         Am
You used to call me on my cell phone
                     Em
Late night when you need my love
               C         Am
Call me on my cell phone
                     Em
Late night when you need my love

[Verse 3]
 
These days, all I do is
C                             Am
Wonder if you bendin' over backwards for someone else
C                             Am
Wonder if you rolling up a backwoods for someone else
C                                   Am
Doing things I taught you gettin' nasty for someone else
Em
You don't need no one else
Em                           C
You don't need nobody else, no
                Am
Why you never alone
                        C
Why you always touching road
                        Am
Used to always stay at home, be a good girl
                Em
You was in the zone
                   Em
You should just be yourself
                           Em
Right now, you're someone else

[Verse]
     F                   C

It would make me believe what tomorrow could bring,

I know you were right, believing for so long.

I'm all out of love, what am I without you,
   F/A                  F            G       C
I can't be too late to say that I was so wrong.

Away from these long, lonely nights.

                 D                     G
I remember the times we spent together on those drives
         D                      G
We had a million questions all about our lives
             Em                  G
and when we got to New York everything felt right
   E              G       A

and it used to feel like dreamin' except we always woke up
                   E                       G            A

All the times we spilled our coffees and stayed out way too late

I remember the time you sat and told me about your Jesus
             D                   G
and how not to look back even if no one believes us
          Em                        G               A

I let myself get down in the first place

You know you need to get yourself to sleep and dream
    D#m7-5           C#maj7
And dream of you and I
           Fm7-5                D#m7
There's no need to keep an open eye

I promise I'm the one for you

I'm lucky to be near you

N.C.
And so she sat me down and told me that I didn't have to cry
N.C.
Said I didn't need to get down and feel empty inside
N.C.
And told me that she love me for as long as she's alive
N.C.
And well, maybe she's right, cause I hate it when I feel like I'm not me
N.C.
See, I honestly, don't even know why

I, I honestly don't even know why

https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/kings-of-leon/use-somebody-chords-875583,beginner,E A D G B E,,no capo,"['C', 'Em', 'Am', 'F']","Hey guys,
 
Just a little chord tab of how I play Use Somebody by The Kings of Leon on
acoustic. The Em DOES work and a few of the suggested replacements really don't sound right at all.
I also didn't tab the bridge because I don't think it flows well on acoustic as it goes straight into the solo
on the original version. Capo on 1st fret optional. All chords are the standard chords.
 
 
Chords used:
 
C Em F Am   (yes its that simple)
 
 
[Intro]
 
C          Em         F
Ohhh Woahh Ohhh Woahh Ohhh     
C          Em         F
Ohhh Woahh Ohhh Woahh Ohhh   
 
Am         C          F
Ohhh Woahh Ohhh Woahh Ohhh     
 
(let the F ring, begin singing the first few lines
as the F dies out)
 
 
[Verse]
 
                  C                      Em            F
I've been roaming around, always looking down at all I see
F       C              Em             F
Painted faces fill the places I can't reach
F                     Am         C            F
You know that I could use somebody
F                     Am         C            F   (once again let it ring)
You know that I could use somebody
 
 
[Chorus]
 
             C               Em               F
Someone like you and all you know and how you speak
F         C            Em           F
Countless lovers under cover of the streets
F                     Am         C            F
You know that I could use somebody

Off in the night while you live it up I'm off to sleep
F      C                 Em           F
Waging wars to shape the poet and the beat
F                 Am            C             F
I hope it's gonna make you notice
F                 Am            C             F
(Let F ring...again)
I hope it's gonna make you notice
 
 
[Chorus]
 
             C          Em            F
Someone like meeeeeeee  eee                  
             C          Em            F
Someone like meeeeeeee  eee              
        Am        C                   F
Someone me, somebody
        Am        C                   F
Someone me, somebody
             Am          C            F    (let the ring)
Someone like you, somebody
                  C                      Em            F
I've been roaming around, always looking down at all I see
 
 
---------------------------------End-----------------------------------------
 
I hope you can understand it how i play it. if your un sure about the bit with
letting the F's ring, or you think its wrong let me know and i'll try explain it
better. Other than that, i hope you guys have a really awesome time playing a
really awesome song!
 Please rate and comment what you thought, as this is my first tab. Feedback MUCH
:)
 
-----Edit-----
 
When playing the F chord in the verses try and let your finger catch the high E string
you got for an up strum :) just adds a little something extra in there.

Do I look lonely? I see the shadows on my face,
            Dm       G                C    Am
People have told me, I don't look the same,

So he probably played it in 1968 using E-shapes and used a capo 1st fret.
 
For the (original) E-shapes transpose +4 and use a capo 1st fret
to match the Beatles' recording.
 
For chords in the original key transpose this chord sheet +5.

F  C  Am     G
          As long as you love me
F  C  Am   G
 
 
[Verse 1]
 
         Am                           F
Although loneliness has always been a friend of mine
    G                       C         G/B
I'm leavin' my life in your hands
Am                            F
People say I'm crazy and that I am blind
G                   C           G/B
Risking it all in a glance
    Am                              F
And how you got me blind is still a mystery
  G                       C        G/B
I can't get you out of my head
Am                                 F
Don't care what is written in your history
     G            C
As long as you're here with me
 
 
[Chorus]
 
             F
I don't care who you are

Where you're from

What you did

As long as you love me
  F
Who you are
  C
Where you're from

Don't care what you did
      G
As long as you love me
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
Am                                F
Every little thing that you have said and done
G                           C         G/B
Feels like it's deep within me
Am                              F
Doesn't really matter if you're on the run
   G                         C           G/B
It seems like we're meant to be
 
 
[Chorus]
 
               F
I don't care who you are (who you are)
  C
Where you're from (where you're from)
  Am
What you did
     G
As long as you love me (I don't know)
  F
Who you are (who you are)
  C
Where you're from (where you're from)
               Am/F     Am/E
Don't care what you did

As long as you love me (yeah)
 
 
[Solo]
 
F  C  Am  G
F  C  Am  Am/E  E
 
 
[Bridge]
 
Am                               C
   I've tried to hide it so that no one knows
      F
But I guess it shows
         F      G     Am
When you look into my eyes
                              C
What you did and where you're comin from
        F#m7b5   Fmaj7       G          F  C  Am  G
I don't care, as long as you love me, baby
 
 
[Chorus]
 
             F
I don't care who you are
  C
Where you're from
  Am
What you did

As long as you love me
  F
Who you are
  C
Where you're from

Don't care what you did

As long as you love me
 
 
[Chorus]
 
F
Who you are
  C
Where you're from
           Am
don't care what you did
      G
As long as you love me
F        C
 Who you are
             Am
Where you're from

what you did

As long as you love me

[Outro]

(Lennon/McCartney)
A Hard Day's Night (1964)
 
Most of the C chords here can be played as C7, too. The 7th is there somewhere in the
Beatles' recording, but when played without a band with one guitar only, it might be
a little too much. Some of the comments here suggest to play the 7th chords as barree
rather than their open versions. Might be a solution. It's probably a matter of taste,
whether to put it in or leave it out.

[Verse 1]
 
C          G                Am            F                 C
  So lately you're wondering who will be there to take my place
             G                Am            F                C
When I'm gone you'll need love to light the shadows on your face
      G                Am       F            C
If a great wave shall fall and fall upon us all
        G                   Am             F
Then between the sand and stone could you make it on your own?
 
 
[Chorus]
 
C           G            Am            F              C
  If I could then I would, I'll go wherever you will go
           G           Am            F              C
Way up high or down low, I'll go wherever you will go
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
(C)      G             Am        F                 C
And maybe I'll find out a way to make it back someday
           G            Am           F                C
To want you to guide you through the darkest of your days
      G                Am       F            C
If a great wave shall fall and fall upon us all
        G                    Am               F
Then I hope there's someone out there who can bring me back to you
 
 
[Chorus]
 
C           G            Am            F              C
  If I could then I would, I'll go wherever you will go
           G           Am            F             Am
Way up high or down low, I'll go wherever you will go
 
 
[Bridge]
 
(Am)   F                G
       Run away with my heart
Em               Am
Run away with my hope
F                 G        Em
Run away with my love
 
 
[Verse 3] (Play intro until second F)
 
C           G
  I know now just quite how
Am            F                    C
  My life and love might still go on
             G
In your heart, in your mind
Am                F              C
  I'll stay with you for all of time
 
 
[Chorus]
 
(C)       G            Am            F              C
If I could then I would, I'll go wherever you will go
           G           Am            F              C
Way up high or down low, I'll go wherever you will go
 
           G          Am               F              C
If I could turn back time, I'll go wherever you will go
           G         Am               F              C
If I could make you mine, I'll go wherever you will goooooooo
 
G      Am              F              C       G      Am    F
ooooo      I'll go wherever you will goooooooooooooo

CAPO 2
 
 
[Verse 1]
 
G               D       C             G
We'll do it all, everything, on our own.
G          D        C         G
We don't need anything, or anyone.
 
 
[Chorus]
 
         G               D
If I lay here, if I just lay here
              C                                 G
Would you lie with me, and just forget the world.
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
G              D           C            G
I don't quite know how to say how I feel
G               D               C               G
Those three words are said too much, but not enough.
 
 
[Chorus]
 
         G               D
If I lay here, if I just lay here
              C                                 G
Would you lie with me, and just forget the world.
 
 
[Bridge]
 
                  G                   D
Forget what we're told, before we get too old
           C                            G
Show me a garden that's bursting into life.
 
 
[Verse 3]
 
G               D           C                G
Let's waste time, chasing cars, around our heads.
G               D           C               G
I need your grace to remind me, to find my own.
 
 
[Chorus]
 
         G               D
If I lay here, if I just lay here
              C                                  G
Would you lie with me, and just forget the world.
 
 
[Bridge]
 
                  G                   D
Forget what we're told, before we get too old
          C                                G
Show me a garden that's bursting into life.
 
 
[Verse 4]
 
           G              D
All that I am, all that I ever was 
                C                                  G
Is here in your perfect eyes, they're all I can see
             G                     D
I don't know where, confused about how as well
                     C                                      G
just know that these things will never change for us at all.
 
 
[Chorus]
 
         G               D
If I lay here, if I just lay here
              C                                  G
Would you lie with me, and just forget the world.

[Verse 1]
Amaj7                      C#7
  Moon, a hole of light, through the big top tent up high
D                         Dm
Here before and after me, shinin' down on me
Amaj7                      C#7
  Moon, tell me if I could send up my heart to you
 D                                        Dm
So when I die, which I must do, could it shine down here with you?
 
 
[Chorus]
       Amaj7      C#7
'Cause my love is mine, all mine
D       Dm
I love, my, my, mine
Amaj7                   C#7
Nothing in the world belongs to me

But my love, mine, all mine, all mine

   My baby here on earth showed me what my heart was worth

So when it comes to be my turn, could you shine it down here for her?

               Em              D              Cadd9
And where your love has always been enough for me.
G               D
I'm not running from.
      Cadd9              D
No, I think you got me all wrong.
Em                  D              Cadd9
I don't regret this life I chose for me.
          Em                 D                 Cadd9
But these places and these faces are getting old,
              Em               D               Cadd9
I said these places and these faces are getting old,
             Em   D Cadd9  Em D Cadd9
So I'm going home.
          G
I'm going home.

[Verse 1]
  G
I hear the train a comin', it's rollin' round the bend
                                                 G7
and I ain't seen the sunshine since I don't know when
    C                                              G
I'm stuck in Folsom Prison and time keeps draggin' on
         D7                                     G
But that train keeps a rollin' on down to San Antone
 
[Verse 2]
     G
When I was just a baby my Mama told me ""Son
                                           G7
always be a good boy; don't ever play with guns"".
      C                                     G
But I shot a man in Reno, just to watch him die
       D7                                           G
When I hear that whistle blowin' I hang my head and cry

[Verse 3]
  G
I bet there's rich folks eating from a fancy dining car
                                                   G7
They're probably drinking coffee and smokin' big cigars
        C                                       G
Well, I know I had it comin', I know I can't be free
          D7                                            G
But those people keep a movin' and that's what tortures me

Well, if they freed me from this prison, if that railroad train was mine
                                               G7
I bet I'd move it on a little farther down the line
C                                              G
Far from Folsom Prison, that's where I want to stay
        D7                                       G
And I'd let that lonesome whistle blow my blues away

Artist: Rolling Stones
Album: Sticky Fingers
Tabbed By: Michael MacMillan
Here's a great and easy strum-along song by the Stones. It's essentially
three chords throughout the whole song and it has a country feel to it.
 
[Intro]
Dsus2 D  A  G  D
 
[Verse 1]
D                         A              G                 D
Well, when you're sittin' there, in your silk upholstered chair
D               A                  G       D
Talkin' to some rich folk that you know
D                          A          G          D
Well, I hope you won't see me, in my ragged company
D                       A        G     D
cause you know I could never be alone
 
[Pre-chorus]
         A                          D
Take me down little Suzie, take me down
  A                                           D
I know you think you're the queen of the underground
 
[Chorus]
        G                              D    Dsus4 D Dsus2
You can send me dead flowers every morning
G                           D Dsus4 D Dsus2
Send me dead flowers by the mail
G                          D Dsus4 D Dsus2
Send me dead flowers at my wedding
      D                    A            G     D
And I won't forget to put roses on your grave
 
[Verse 2]
D                         A                 G        D
Well, when you're sittin' back in your rose pink Cadillac
D              A              G      D
Makin' bets on Kentucky Derby day
D                            A           G            D
Well, I'll be in my basement room with a needle and a spoon
    D                A            G      D
And another girl can take my pain away
 
[Pre-chorus]
        A                           D
Take me down little Suzie, take me down
  A                                           D

Send me dead flowers by the U.S. mail

Say it with dead flowers at my wedding

  Hi!  I love this song and it's so fun to play! A regular
'A' can be used for the A4 but I think they're easier and
it sounds just as good. Have fun!

D                   A                          G
I used to think one day we'd tell the story of us
                                        D
How we met and the sparks flew instantly
             A                           G
People would say, ""They're the lucky ones""
D                 A                        G
I used to know my place was a spot next to you
                                            D
Now I'm searching the room for an empty seat
                           A                       G
'Cause lately I don't even know what page you're on
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
 
A                  Bm
Oh, a simple complication
          G              D
Miscommunications lead to fall out
G
So many things that I wish you knew
A
So many walls that I can't break through
 
 
[Chorus]
 
D                Asus4              G
Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room

And we're not speaking
                 Asus4             G
And I'm dying to know is it killing you
(G)
Like it's killing me?
Bm                   A                    D

When it all broke down
        Bm                  A                  G    N.C.

D                    A
How'd we end up this way?

See me nervously pulling at my clothes
                       D
And trying to look busy
                      A               G
And you're doing your best to avoid me
 
D                         A                          G
I'm starting to think one day I'll tell the story of us
                                            D
How I was losing my mind when I saw you here
                  A                               G
But you held your pride like you should have held me

Oh, we're scared to see the ending
           G                  D
Why are we pretending this is nothing?
G
I'd tell you I miss you but I don't know how

I've never heard silence quite this loud

But I liked it better when you were on my side
D                             G
The battle's in your hands now
(G)
But I would lay my armor down
   Bm              A                G
If you'd say you'd rather love than fight
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]

So many things that you wish I knew

[Chorus]
 
D (2x *fast/stop)
  Now I'm standing alone
 Asus4 (2x*)       G -once             G
      In a crowded room  and we're not speaking
        D        Asus4              G
And I'm dying to know is it killing you
                  G
Like it's killing me?
Bm                   A                    D
I don't know what to say since a twist of fate
                  G
When it all broke down
        Bm
And the story of us
        A                  G                D  Asus4
Looks a lot like a tragedy now, now, no-----ow
 
 
[Outro]
 
G                        D
   And we're not speaking
                 Asus4              G
And I'm dying to know is it killing you
(G)
Like it's killing me?
Bm                   A                    D
I don't know what to say since a twist of fate
                   G
'Cause we're going down
        Bm                  A                  G     N.C.
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now - The end

[Verse 1]
  G                                    C
I met a gin-soaked barroom queen in Memphis
    G                A               D
She tried to take me upstairs for a ride
    G                                  C
She had to heave me right across her shoulder
         G                  D                 G
‘cause I just can't seem to drink you off my mind
 
[Chorus]

It's the ho-oooo-nky tonk women
     G             D                    G
That gimme, gimme, gimme the honky-tonk blues
 
[Verse 2]
  G                            C
I laid a divorcee in New York City
  G              A              D
I had to put up some kind of a fight
    G                            C
The lady then she covered me in roses
    G                D                 G
She blew my nose and then she blew my mind
 
[Chorus]

It's the ho-oooo-nky tonk women
     G             D                    G

You're just too good to be true
              Dmaj7
Can't take my eyes off you

The sight of you leaves me weak

So if you feel like I feel

Please let me know that it's real

F                         Dm
  How can I decide what’s right
                           Am
when you’re clouding up my mind
 
I can’t win your losing
Em
fight all the time
F                           Dm
  Nor can I ever own what’s mine
                          Am
when you’re always taking sides
 
But you won’t take away
   Em                 F     Dm
my pride, no not this time
         Am Em
Not this time

  How did we get here

  When I used

to know you so well

  The truth is hiding in your

eyes and it’s hanging
        Am
on your tongue
                   Em
Just boiling in my blood
                           F
but you think that I can’t see
 
What kind of man that you
Dm                     Am
are if you’re a man at all
 
Well, I will figure
         Em        F Dm
this one out on my own
                         Am
I’m screaming I love you so

We’re gonna make such

[ZAYN]

Your hand fits in mine like it's made just for me
    Fmaj7
But bear this in mind it was meant to be
       Am                            G
And I'm joining up the dots with the freckles on your cheeks

I know you've never loved the crinkles by your eyes

When you smile you've never loved your stomach or your thighs

But if I do, it’s you, oh it’s you they add up to

[LOUIS]
 
C
You can’t go to bed without a cup of tea
    Fmaj7
And maybe that’s the reason that you talk in your sleep
    Am                              G
And all those conversations are the secrets that I keep
          Fmaj7     G                C
Though it makes no sense to me
 
 
[HARRY]

I know you’ve never loved the sound of your voice on tape
Fmaj7
  You never want to know how much you weigh
Am                                      G
You still have to squeeze into your jeans

   You’ll never treat yourself right darlin’ but I want you to
Fmaj7             Am       C        G
   If I let you know I’m here for you

It starts with an Am7. You can play it open on the neck or barred if you like.
Play it for 4 bars of 6/8, then go into the lyrics.
 
Am7  x02213
 
 
[Verse 1]
 
Am7              Fadd9
Drink up, baby, stay up all night.
           C
With the things you could do,
     Em7/B
You won't but you might.
       Am7
The potential you'll be,
       Fadd9
That you'll never see,
      C        E7         F
The promises you'll only make.
      Am7
Drink up with me now,
        Fadd9
And forget all about
       C
The pressure of days.
Em7/B
Do what I say,
          Am7
And I'll make you okay,
      Fadd9
And drive them away
    C      E7            F
The images stuck in your head
 
 
[Chorus]
 
F  G6  Am*
People you've been before
         Fm/Ab Em/G   Am      Am/F#
That you don't want around anymore -
      F        G6             Am*
That push and shove and won't bend to your will.
F                 Fm
  I'll keep them still.
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
Am7               Fadd9
Drink up, baby, look at the stars.
      C
I'll kiss you again
Em7/B
Between the bars,
            Am7
Where I'm seeing you there,
            Fadd9
With your hands in the air,
C            E7         F
Waiting to finally be caught.
      Am7
Drink up one more time,
     Fadd9
And I'll make you mine.
C
Keep you apart,
Em7/B
Deep in my heart,
      Am7
Separate from the rest,
         Fadd9
Where I like you the best,
    C         E7           F
And keep the things you forgot.
 
 
[Chorus]
 
    F  G6  Am*
The people you've been before
         Fm/Ab Em/G   Am      Am/F#
That you don't want around anymore -
      F        G6             Am*
That push and shove and won't bend to your will.
F                 Fm
  I'll keep them still.

* There's a riff here.. It's pretty simple, and all the notes receive an even time. Just
listen to the record and you should be able to hear the rhythm.

Note: for the Am/F#, I like to just reach across with my middle finger, which is on the
2nd fret of the D string using my Am open fingering, and hit the second fret on the low E
The point of my finger holds down the string while the fleshy part mutes the A string. I
think this sounds better and is a lot easier than using some weird fingering to get a proper
chord with all six strings ringing.

[Verse 1]
            C                      Em                   Am
Baby really hurt me, crying in the taxi, he don't wanna know me
                     G                        F
Says he made the big mistake of dancing in my storm 
Am/E             Dm G
     Says it was poison
 
                C             Em                      Am
So I guess I go home into the arms of the girl that I love
                G                  F
The only love I haven't screwed up
                 Am/E               Dm          G
She's so hard to please but she's a forest fire
 
        C                         Em                       Am
I do my best to meet her demands, play at romance, we slow dance in the living room
    G                         F
But all that a stranger would see
       Am/E          Dm                G
Is one girl swaying alone stroking her cheek
 
 
[Chorus 1]

They say, you're a little much for me

You're a liability

You're a little much for me
 
             C                Em            Am
So they pull back, make other plans, I understand

I'm a liability
        Am/E           Dm
Get you wild, make you leave

[Verse 2]

The truth is I am toy that people enjoy
                G                    F
'Til all of the tricks don't work anymore 
Am/E                   Dm       G
     And then they are bored of me
 
                   C                          Em
I know that it's exciting running through the night but
              Am                  G                 F
Every perfect summer's eating me alive until you're gone
Am/E        Dm    G
     Better on my own
 
 
[Chorus 2]

Em            Am            G             F
They're gonna watch me disappear into the sun

You're all gonna watch me disappear into the sun

Now you'll have to find out by yourself what rhythm do you want to play, for example in
the intro bit you can only strum the chords once...but if you are playing by yourself
like on an acoustic then it may not sound all that impressive...so what I do is play
the chords,
 G C in (D D UDUDUDUD DD) each and then
 F (D D) C (D D) G (D D UDUD)
adding lil' dead notes before switching to the next chord, and I swear the rythm
changes every time I play.
So figure out the pattern you'll enjoy strumming for this song!
 
Rhythm A :-
Rhythm for the parts before the verses and in the verses...
G5 -(DDUD) -Strike Damp Notes- F5 -(UDU) C5 -(D) Bb5 -(D) x3
C5- (DUDUDDUD)
C5-Bb5-G-F
 
Intro: Play G (Open) slide your strumming finger/pick from the low E string to the
higher e..going through one string at a time
then play G (Barre) C  F  C  G  x2
 
Play the chorus part with the into rhythm
 
 
[Chorus]
 
G (Open)
Take me down to the paradise city
            C
Where the grass is green
 C
And the girls are pretty
F               C              G (Open)
Oh, won't you please take me home
G (Barre)
Take me down to the paradise city
            C
Where the grass is green
And the girls are pretty
F               C              G
Oh, won't you please take me home
 
 
Play: (Since no singing is required here you can strum the chords once)
 
   v   ^ v ^ v   ^ v ^ v v v
e|-3---X-X-X-0---X-X-X-1-0-3|
B|-0---X-X-X-1---X-X-X-1-1-0|
G|-0---X-X-X-0---X-X-X-2-0-0| x2
D|-0---------2---------3-2-0|
A|-2---------3---------3-3-2|
E|-3-----------------------3|
 
Play the whole thing twice, then play the power chords part i.e. Rhythm A.

The surgeon general says it's hazardous to breathe

[Verse]
                  G
I took a pill in Ibiza
         D
To show Avicii I was cool
           Cadd9
And when I finally got sober, felt 10 years older
    G
But fuck it, it was something to do
                  G
I'm living out in LA
          D
I drive a sports car just to prove
      Cadd9
I'm a real big baller cause I made a million dollar
      G
And I spend it on girls and shoes
 
[Pre-Chorus]
                       Em7
But you don't wanna be high like me
                     D
Never really knowing why like me
                     Cadd9                                    G
You don't ever wanna step off that roller coaster and be all alone
                         Em7
You don't wanna ride the bus like this
                     D
Never knowing who to trust like this
                   Cadd9
You don't wanna be stuck up on that stage singing
Cadd9
Stuck up on that stage singing
 
[Chorus]
G     D            Cadd9      G
All I know are sad songs, sad songs

Darling, all I know are sad songs, sad songs
 
[Verse]
           G            D
I'm just a singer who already blew his shot
       Cadd9
I get along with old timers
                                G
Cause my name's a reminder of a pop song people forgot
                   G
And I can't keep a girl, no
         D
Cause as soon as the sun comes up
  Cadd9
I cut em all loose and work's my excuse
        G
But the truth is I can't open up
 
[Pre-Chorus]
                       Em7
But you don't wanna be high like me

I took a plane to my home town
             D
I brought my pride and my guitar
       Cadd9
All my friends are all gone but there's manicured lawns
        G
And the people still think I'm a star
                G
I walked around downtown
           D
I met some fans on Lafayette
          Cadd9
They said tell us how to make it cause we're getting real impatient
     G
So I looked em in the eye and said

Stuck up on that stage singing

Well, my buckle makes impressions on the inside of her thigh
          G
There are little feathered Indians where we tussled through the night
       D                                A
If I'd known she was religious then I wouldn't have came stoned
        G
To the house of such an angel too fucked up to get back home
 
[Interlude]
D A G  x2
 
[Verse 2]
        D                           A
Lookin' over West Virginia, smoking spirits on the roof

Like a little feathered Indian calling out the clouds for rain

I go runnin' through the thicket, I go careless through the thorns

G                           C           F
And every occasion, oh, one billion day funeral
 
 
[Verse]
 
F             C       G           Am
I'm coming up only to show you're down for
F             C       G           Am
And coming up only to show you're wrong
 
F      C            G               Am
To the outside, the dead leaves lay on the lawn
F   C               G        Am
For they don't have trees to hang upon
 
F C G Am
Oooooooooooh

At every occasion, oh, I'm ready for the funeral

And every occasion, oh, one billion day funeral

[Verse]
 
Am
A hundred days have made me older,
          G                                 Am F G
Since the last time that I saw your pretty face,
 
           Am
A thousand lies have made me colder,
       G                                 Am F G
And I don't think I can look at this the same,
Am                          G
And all the miles that separate,
Am                           F               G
They disappear now when I'm dreamin' of your face.
 
 
[Chorus]
 
C                       G
I'm here without you baby,
                              Am
But you're still on my lonely mind,
                       F            G                C
I think about you baby and I dream about you all the time,
C                        G
I'm here without you baby,
                               Am
But you're still with me in my dreams,
 
     F            G            Am   G

The miles just keep rolling as the people leave their way to say hello,
 
                Am                      G                          Am        F  G
I've heard this life is overrated, but I hope it gets better as we go, woah, yeah

I think about you baby and I dream about you all the time,

I'm here without you baby,

Am
Everything I Know,
C
And everywhere I go,
G                         F              Am
It gets hard but it won't take away my love,
Am                      C
And when the last one falls,
                        G                           F                    C   G Am F G
When it's all said and done, it gets hard but won't take, away, my love, oh, oh

[Verse 1]
 
Gm                             Eb      Cm
   Have you got colour in your cheeks?
                                         Gm
Do you ever get that fear that you can't shift the type
                        Gm
That sticks around like summat in your teeth
               Eb           Cm
Are there some aces up your sleeve
                                Gm
Have you no idea that you're in deep
                          Gm
I dreamt about you nearly every night this week
         Eb          Cm
How many secrets can you keep?
                                     Gm
Cause there's this tune I found that makes me think of you somehow
       Gm
When I play it on repeat
Eb         Cm
   Until I fall asleep
                      D
Spilling drinks on my settee
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
 
       Eb
(Do I wanna know)
         Cm
If this feeling floats both ways
         Gm
(Sad to see you go)
Was sort of hoping that you'd stay
          Eb
(Baby, we both know)
          Cm
That the nights were mainly made
           Gm
for saying things that you can't say tomorrow day
 
 
[Chorus]
 
                 Gm
Crawling back to you
                Eb      Cm
Ever thought of calling when you've had a few?
                Gm
'Cause I always do
          Gm             Eb       Cm
Maybe I'm too busy being yours to fall for somebody new
                    Gm
Now I've thought it through
                 Gm
Crawling back to you
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
(Gm)                Eb     Cm
So have you got the guts?
                                     Gm
Been wondering if your heart's still open and
              Gm
if so I wanna know what time it shuts
Eb                 Cm
   Simmer down and pucker up
                             Gm                                 Gm        Eb
I'm sorry to interrupt, it's just I'm constantly on the cusp of trying to kiss you
Cm                                  Gm
   but I don't know if you feel the same as I do
Gm                 Eb       Cm
   But we could be together
              D
if you wanted to

Chord Notes: This song drives on the 2nd string B, C# and D for the Riff.
(Open B/2nd string, C# 2nd fret/2nd string and D 3rd fret/2nd string)
Keep this in mind when fretting and strumming the following chords.
i.e. play the Em7 with your pinky on the D 3rd fret/2nd string instead of the familiar
one finger on the 2nd fret/5th string.

So you could sit there in this hurt

Because I dropped your hand while dancing
                           Am
Left you out there standing
 
Crestfallen on the landing
F
Champagne problems

Don't think we'll say that word again

Sometimes you just don't know the answer

E                                       F#m
I've been staring at the edge of the water
                 C#m                           A
'Long as I can remember, never really knowing why

                       C#m                           A
But I come back to the water, no matter how hard I try
 
 
[Pre-Chorus 1]
       C#m
Every turn I take, every trail I track
       B/D#
Every path I make, every road leads back
        E
To the place I know, where I cannot go

Where I long to be
 
 
[Chorus A]
         E                                   B
See the line where the sky meets the sea? It calls me

And no one knows, how far it goes
         E                                 B

I know, everybody on this island seems so happy on this island
                   A
Everything is by design
E                          F#m                         C#m
I know, everybody on this island has a role on this island

So maybe I can roll with mine
 
 
[Pre-Chorus 2]
       C#m
I can lead with pride, I can make us strong
         B/D#
I'll be satisfied if I play along

But the voice inside sings a different song

What is wrong with me?
 
 
[Chorus B]

See the light as it shines on the sea? It's blinding

But no one knows, how deep it goes
        E                                          B
And it seems like it's calling out to me, so come find me

And let me know, what's beyond that line, will I cross that line?
 
 
[Chorus A] (key change)

  Well, you can take me down with just one single blow

But you don't know what you don't know
 
 
[Chorus]
 
D       A       Bm                  G
Someday I'll be livin' in a big ol' city

And all you're ever gonna be is mean
D       A       Bm                      G
Someday I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
    D          A                G
And all you're ever gonna be is mean

Why you gotta be so mean?

[Verse 2]
 
Bm             A
You, with your switching sides and
     G                       G
Your wild fire lies and your humiliation
Bm         A                   G
You, have pointed out my flaws again
        G     N.C.
As if I don't already see them
Bm            A
I walk with my head down
          G
tryin' to block you out
         G
'cause I never impress you
Bm      A           G
I just wanna feel okay again
 
 
[Pre-Chorus 2]
 
A
  I bet you got pushed around
D        G         A
Somebody made you cold
A
But the cycle ends right now 'cause
G
You can't lead me down that road
G
And you don't know what you don't know
 
 
[Chorus]

[Bridge]
 
            A
And I can see you years from now in a bar
D              G        A
Talkin' over a football game
A
With that same big loud opinion
D            G     A
But nobody's listening
A
Washed up and ranting about the
D        A      G
same old bitter things
A                                D A     G
Drunk and rumblin' all about how I can't sing
N.C.              D     A
But all you are is mean
G              D           A         D
All you are is mean, and a liar, and pathetic
     G                D         A         D         G
And alone in life and mean, and mean, and mean, and mean
 
 
[Chorus]
 
    D       A       Bm                  G
But someday I'll be livin' in a big ol' city
    D          A                G
And all you're ever gonna be is mean...yeahh
D       A       Bm                      G
Someday I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
    D          A                G
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
                      D
Why you gotta be so.. Someday
A       Bm                  G
I'll be livin' in a big ol' city
    D          A                G
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
D       A       Bm                      G

Bbmaj7
Girl, I'm in love with you
Ebmaj7
This ain't the honeymoon
Ebmaj7               Fmaj7
Past the infatuation phase
Bbmaj7
Right in the thick of love
Ebmaj7
At times we get sick of love
Ebmaj7                        Fmaj7
It seems like we argue every day
 
       Bbmaj7                   Ebmaj7                                           Fmaj7
I know I misbehave and you made your mistakes and we both still got room left to grow
           Bbmaj7                     Ebmaj7
And though love sometimes hurts, I still put you first and we'll make this thing work
      Fmaj7
but I think we should take it slow
 
 
[Chorus]
 
Bbmaj7               Ebmaj7
We're just ordinary people
Ebmaj7                Fmaj7
We don't know which way to go
Bbmaj7                Ebmaj7
'Cause we're ordinary people
Ebmaj7                Fmaj7
Maybe we should take it slow
 
     Bbmaj7        Ebmaj7
Take it slow-oh oh-oh-oh
Ebmaj7                Fmaj7
This time we'll take it slow
     Bbmaj7        Ebmaj7
Take it slow-oh oh-oh-oh
Ebmaj7                Fmaj7
This time we'll take it slow
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
Bbmaj7
This ain't a movie, no
Ebmaj7
No fairy tale conclusion, ya'll
Ebmaj7                       Fmaj7
It gets more confusing every day
Bbmaj7
Sometimes it's heaven sent
      Ebmaj7
Then we head back to hell again
Ebmaj7                           Fmaj7
We kiss, then we make up all the way
 
Bbmaj7
I hang up, you call
Ebmaj7
We rise and we fall
Ebmaj7                         Fmaj7
And we feel like just walking away
Bbmaj7
As our love advances
Ebmaj7
We take second chances
Ebmaj7               Fmaj7
Though it's not a fantasy
Ebmaj7               Fmaj7
I still want you to stay...

This time we'll take it slow
 
 
[Bridge]
 
Bbm                       Db/Eb
Maybe we'll live and learn, maybe we'll crash and burn
Fmaj7
Maybe you'll stay, maybe you'll leave, maybe you'll return
Bbm                 Db/Eb
Maybe another fight, maybe we won't survive
Fmaj7
Maybe we'll grow, we never know, baby you and I

Kasih sayang kamu begitu dalam

            F
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet,
     G
Lead her up the stairwell
           C                    Am
This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town,
            F                           G
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down,
         Am              G/B        F                      C
Now it's too late for you and your white horse to come around
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
C              F
Maybe I was naïve,
 
Got lost in your eyes
    Am                        F
And never really had a chance
C                         F
My mistake, I didn't know to be in love
           Am                            F
You had to fight to have the upper hand
 
      Am
I had so many dreams
      F
About you and me
      G
Happy endings
Now I know
 
 
[Chorus]
                  C                   Am
That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairy tale,
            F
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet,
     G
Lead her up the stairwell
           C                    Am
This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town,
            F                           G
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down,
         Am              G/B        F                      C
Now it's too late for you and your white horse to come around
Am F G Am
 
[Bridge]
Am            G/B         F
And there you are on your knees,
C              G/B      F
Begging for forgiveness, begging for me
C           G/B          F           Bb
Just like I always wanted but I'm so sorry
 
 
[Chorus]
                   C                         Am
Cause I'm not your princess, this ain't a fairytale,
           F                              G
I'm gonna find someone someday who might actually treat me well
          C                     Am
This is a big world, that was a small town
            F                        G
There in my rear view mirror disappearing now
            Am           G/B            F
And it's too late for you and your white horse
            Am           G/B            F                 C
Now it's too late for you and your white horse to catch me now
 
[Outro]
F        Am
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa
F                    C
Try and catch me now
  F Am            F
Oh, it's too late

To catch me now

There is a swelling storm

       G          Bm                              D

Why can't I hold on?

[Verse 1]
 
D                  A
He is sensible and so incredible
    Em                        G
And all my single friends are jealous
D                    A
He says everything I need to hear and it's like
Em                         G
I couldn't ask for anything better
D                       A
He opens up my door and I get into his car
    Em                            Gm
And he says you look beautiful tonight
           Gm
And I feel perfectly fine
 
 
[Chorus]
 
           D
But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
         A
And it's 2 am and I'm cursing your name
       Em
You're so in love that you act insane
    G                A
And that's the way I loved you
D
  Breakin' down and coming undone
      A
It's a roller coaster kinda rush
     Em
And I never knew I could feel that much
    G                Gm     D
And that's the way I loved you
 
 
[Interlude]
 
|(D)    | A     | Em    | G  A  |
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
D                         A
He respects my space, and never makes me wait
    Em                       G
And he calls exactly when he says he will
D                        A
He's close to my mother, talks business with my father
     Em
He's charming and endearing
        Gm
And I'm comfortable
 
 
[Chorus]
 
           D
But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
         A
And it's 2 am and I'm cursing your name

You're so in love that you act insane

[Bridge]
 
Em                         G
He can't see the smile I'm faking
                   D
And my heart's not breaking
                       A
'Cause I'm not feeling anything at all
    Em
And you were wild and crazy
G                      D
Just so frustrating, intoxicating, complicated
A                            G
Got away by some mistake and now
 
 
[Chorus]
 
       D
I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
     A
It's 2 am and I'm cursing your name
    Em
I'm so in love that I acted insane
    G                A
And that's the way I loved you
D
  Breakin' down and coming undone

And I never knew I could feel that much

And that's the way I loved you, oh
    G                A        D A
And that's the way I loved you, oh
Em
   Never knew I could feel that much

Am           G           F       C
This is my prayer in the desert
     Am             G           F    C
When all that’s within me feels dry
Am         G            F          C

In weakness or trial or pain

[Verse]
 
C              Em        D                    C
      I found god On the corner of first and Amistad
          Em        D       C
Where the west was all but won
Em         D                C
All alone, smoking his last cigarette
                 Em            D      C
I Said where you been, he said ask anything         
 
           Em
Where were you?
     D              C
When everything was falling apart
       Em        D            C
All my days were spent by the telephone
         Em
It never rang
    D             C
And all I needed was a call
           Em
That never came
       D                   C
To the corner of first and Amistad
 
 
[Chorus]
 
Em         C      G             D
Lost and insecure You found me, you found me
Em       C         G           D
Lying on the floor Surrounded, surrounded
Em               C     G               D
Whyd you have to wait? Where were you? Where were you?
Em            C    G             D
Just a little late You found me, you found me
 
 
[Verse]
 
       Em  D                C
In the end everyone ends up alone
       Em   D                     C
Losing her, the only one whos ever known
      Em  D                 C
Who I am, who Im not, who I want to be
          Em       D                C
No way to know how long she will be next to me

[Bridge]
 
D         C                 D
For early morning, the city breaks
              C
But I've been calling for years and years and years and years
                               D
And you never left me no messages
                            C
You never send me no letters
                         D               C
You got some kind of nerve, taking all I want

Lost and insecure You found me, you found me

Whyd you have to wait? to find me to find me.

[Verse 1]
G        Em7               Cadd9
Elevator buttons and morning air
G                  Em7                     Cadd9
Strangers' silence makes me wanna take the stairs
G                    Em7                Cadd9
If you were here we'd laugh about their vacant stares

But right now, my time is theirs
   G               Em7                    Cadd9
Seems like there's always someone who disapproves

They'll judge it like they know about me and you

And the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do

The jury's out, but my choice is you

Cadd9                   D
So don't you worry your pretty little mind
G                     Em7
People throw rocks at things that shine
    Cadd9      D         Em7
And life makes love look hard

But this love is ours
 
[Verse 2]

You never know what people have up their sleeves
G                     Em7               Cadd9
Ghosts from your past gonna jump out at me

Lurking in the shadows with their lip gloss smiles

But I don't care, cause right now you're mine

And it's not theirs to speculate

Cause I love the gap between your teeth

And I love the riddles that you speak

And any snide remarks from my father about your tattoos will be ignored

Lets talk this over; its not like we're dead.
                       D                           A
Was it something i did? Was it something you said?
                  Bm                               G

Held up so high on such a breakable thread.
 
[Pre-Chorus]

And you were all the things I thought I knew.

You've got your dumb friends, I know what they say.
                    D                                     A

 It's nice to know that you were there,
G                                      A

Love the Way You Lie (featuring Rihanna)
album: Recovery
tabbed by ambient203
 
Tuning: Standard
Capo 3
 
x = muted strings
 
 
Most of the chord tabs for this song look good, but there's a few
alterations in the chords throughout the song I thought I'd note here.
I think the chorus is pretty much exactly the same as the verse, this is
kinda how it should look:
 
Em: Last few strokes should have pinky on G (high e string), right before
the quick up-down between chord changes. It's not very noticeable, but it
makes playing the song more interesting.
 
C: For this, you should have the pinky on G a little earlier, on the first
or second downstroke. This is more accentuated than the brief G in the Em
bar.
 
G: Pretty much just G, with the D on B string for the full sound.
 
D: This is actually Dadd11 in the chorus and verse (not intro), G with an
F# bass note (here it is, I didn't even know the name until I looked it up)
 
E A D G B e
2 x 0 0 3 3
 
Make sure you get the nice down-strokes on the bass notes before playing
full chords. And that's pretty much it. I try and avoid the high e string
until the accentuated note is played (for instance, the C chord with high G)
 
e|         3 D 3      3  3    |  - 3 is the G on pinky for the C chord
B|       ^ ^ V ^ V    ^  ^ V  |
G|       ^ ^ V ^ V    ^  ^ V  |  - D marks the upstroke where you should
D|       ^ ^ V ^ V    ^  ^ V  |    stop playing at the end of a verse
A| ^  ^  ^   V ^   ^  ^  ^ V  |
E| ^ *^  ^         ^          |  -  ^ = downstroke
                                 -  V = upstroke
 
*(occasionally there's an upstroke here, after the chorus in C chord bar)
 
I know that looks unnecessarily complicated, and you can probably figure
it out yourself, but I thought I'd note it out since I've never done it before.
 
 
Here's the piano bit that plays while Rihanna sings for the intro:
The stars are devoiced notes that sound better played almost inaudibly.
Make sure you have a capo on the 3rd fret!

[Intro]
 
           Em                       C
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn,
             G                               Dadd11
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts.
           Em                      C
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry,
             G                                Dadd11
But that's alright because I love the way you lie,
                   (slide on D string)
I love the way you lie
 
 
[Verse]
 
                          Em
I can't tell you what it really is, I can only tell you what it feels like
C
And right now, there's a steel knife in my windpipe
G
I can't breathe, but I still fight while I can fight
Dadd11
As long as the wrong feels right, it's like I'm in flight
Em
High off of love, drunk from my hate,
                      C
it's like I'm huffin' paint and I love it, the more I suffer, I suffocate
G
And right before I'm about to drown, she resuscitates
Dadd11
Me, she fuckin' hates me, and I love it, Wait!
Em
Where you going? I'm leaving you. No you ain't,
C                                                      G
Come back. We're running right back, here we go again, it's so insane
 
 
Cuz when it's going good, it's going great
 
Dadd11
I'm Superman with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane
Em
But when and it's bad, it's awful, I feel so ashamed,
C
I snap ""Who's that dude?"", I don't even know his name
G
I laid hands on her, I'll never stoop so low again
Dadd11                      N.C.
I guess I don't know my own strength
 
 
[Chorus]
 
           Em                       C
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn,
             G                               Dadd11
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts.
           Em                      C
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry,
             G                                Dadd11
But that's alright because I love the way you lie,
                   Em             C
I love the way you lie
                   G              Dadd11       N.C.
I love the way you lie
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
                  Em
You ever love somebody so much, you can barely breathe when you're with 'em?
    C
You meet, and neither one of you even know what hit 'em
         G
Got that warm fuzzy feeling, yeah them chills, used to get 'em
           Dadd11
Now you're gettin' fuckin' sick of lookin' at 'em
                      Em
You swore you'd never hit 'em, never do nothin' to hurt 'em
                           C
Now you're in each other's face spewing venom in your words when you spit 'em
    G
You push, pull each other's hair, scratch, claw, bit 'em
          Dadd11
Throw 'em down, pin 'em, so lost in the moments when you're in 'em
         Em
It's the face that's the culprit, it controls you both
                   C
So they say, you'd best to go your separate ways
                                    G
Guess that they don't know ya cuz today, that was yesterday,
                              Dadd11
Yesterday is over and it's a different day, 
                                                Em
Sound like broken records playing over but you promised her,
                                               C
next time you'd show restraint, you don't get another chance
                                        G
Life is no nintendo game, but you lied again
 
 
Now you get to watch her leave out the window
 
             Dadd11
Guess that's why they call it ""window pane""
 
 
[Chorus]
 
           Em                       C
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn,
             G                               Dadd11
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts.
           Em                      C
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry,
             G                                Dadd11
But that's alright because I love the way you lie,
                   Em             C
I love the way you lie
                   G              Dadd11       N.C.
I love the way you lie
 
 
[Verse 3]
 
              Em
Now I know we said things, did things that we didn't mean
       C
And we fall back into the same patterns, same routine
G
But your temper's just as bad as mine is; you're the same as me
Dadd11
When it comes to love you're just as blinded
    Em
Baby please come back, it wasn't you. Baby it was me,
     C
Maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems
     G
Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano
Dadd11
All I know is I love you too much, to walk away though
Em
Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk
C
Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk?
G
Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball
Dadd11
Next time I'm pissed, I'll aim my fist at the drywall
Em
Next time? There won't be no next time
       C
I apologize, even though I know it's lies
                 G
I'm tired of the games, I just want her back. I know I'm a liar,
       Dadd11                       N.C.
If she ever tries to fuckin' leave again,
 
Ima tie her to the bed and set this house on fire
 
Just gonna
 
 
[Chorus]
 
Em                       C
Stand there and watch me burn,
             G                               Dadd11
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts.
           Em                      C
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry,
             G                                Dadd11
But that's alright because I love the way you lie,
                   Em             C
I love the way you lie
                   G              Dadd11       N.C.
I love the way you lie

[Intro]
 
Em   G   D   A   x4
 
 
[Verse 1]
 
  Em
I remembered black skies
    G               D     A
The lightning all around me
    Em
I remembered each flash
   G             D  A
As time began to blur
       Em
Like a startling sign 
     G                D      A
That fate had finally found me
         C
And your voice was all I heard
       A
That I get what I deserve
 
 
[Chorus]
 
           Em
So give me reason
   G
To prove me wrong
   D                A
To wash this memory clean
        Em
Let the floods cross
    G                D  Dsus4 D
The distance in your eyes
        Em
Give me reason
   G
To fill this hole
   D                  A
Connect the space between
       C                                 D
Let it be enough to reach the truth that lies
 D                 Em   G   D   A
Across this new divide
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
          Em
There was nothing in sight
    G              D     A
But memories left abandoned
          Em
There was nowhere to hide
    G               D A
The ashes fell like snow
        Em
And the ground caved in
  G                   D    A
Between where we were standing
         C
And your voice was all I heard
       A
That I get what I deserve
 
 
[Chorus]
 
           Em
So give me reason
   G
To prove me wrong
   D                A
To wash this memory clean
        Em
Let the floods cross
    G                D
The distance in your eyes
 Dsus4      D      Em
Across this new divide
 
 
[Verse 3]
 
         Em            G
In every loss in every lie
         D                A
In every truth that you deny
           Em                G
And each regret and each goodbye
         D                  A
Was a mistake too great to hide
         C
And your voice was all I heard
      A
But I get what I deserve
 
 
[Chorus]
 
           Em
So give me reason
   G
To prove me wrong
   D                A
To wash this memory clean
        Em
Let the floods cross
    G                D  Dsus4
The distance in your eyes
D       Em
Give me reason
   G
To fill this hole
   D                  A
Connect the space between
       C                                 D
Let it be enough to reach the truth that lies
 D                 Em   G   D
Across this new divide
 A                 Em   G   D
Across this new divide
 A                 Em   G   D   A   x2 (Em)
Across this new divide

NOTES:
1. Since this was TAB'ed I learnt of the existence of 'The Wrecking Crew'.  Their musical contribution is
unmistakable.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVUBpzlELOg; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCTVcNsJGX0
2. My apologies to the UG players, as this TAB had been re-edited without my knowledge.  I have
returned it to a corrected and playable format.  I trust that, you may continue to enjoy it? Ditto #2.
3. ""...AllMusic calls the compilation ""a fascinating, educational listen, even if it's not
necessarily indispensable.""[8] Q gave the ""enlightening"" box set a perfect score and wrote
that ""the backing music tracks sans vocals opens your ears to a bevy of awe-inspiring nuances
previously obscured by singing.  At the same time, the isolated vocal tracks are
nothing less than spiritual in their emotive wallop. ...""
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pet_Sounds_Sessions
4.  ""...The new mixes created for the box set were made in January–February 1996.
Linett wrote: ""In mixing Pet Sounds in stereo, every attempt was made to duplicate the feel and
sound of the original mono mixes. Vocal and instrumental parts that Brian left off the record
in 1966 were noted and duplicated, as were the fades.  To this end, a Scully model 280 4-track
was used to transfer the analog reels to digital multi-tracks – the same model used for
'Pet Sounds'.  The mix was then processed through an original tube console from United Western
Recorders in the 1960's. ...""  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pet_Sounds_Sessions

[Verse]
 
 C        G             Am                 Em
A lonely road, crossed another cold state line
F                C            G
Miles away from those I love purpose hard to find
C          G           Am                 Em
While I recall all the words you spoke to me
      F                  C
Can't help but wish that I was there
      G
Back where I'd love to be, oh yeah
 
 
[Chorus]
 
C    G       Am          G
Dear God the only thing I ask of you is
    F                      C
to hold her when I'm not around,
          G
when I'm much too far away
C        G         Am           G
We all need that person who can be true to you
       F               C
But I left her when I found her
    G
And now I wish I'd stayed
            F             G
’Cause I'm lonely and I'm tired
    Em            Am  G  F
I'm missing you again oh no
           C
Once again
 
 
[Verse]
 
C                G          Am              Em
There's nothing here for me on this barren road
        F                         C
There's no one here while the city sleeps
      G
and all the shops are closed
C              G            Am                  Em
Can't help but think of the times I've had with you
F                 C              G
Pictures and some memories will have to help me through, oh yeah
 
 
[Chorus]
 
C    G        Am           G
Dear God the only thing I ask of you is
     F                        C
to hold her when I'm not around,
          G

C      G         Am             G
We all need that person who can be true to you

I left her when I found her
    G
And now I wish I'd stayed
           F              G
’Cause I'm lonely and I'm tired
    Em          Am    G  F
I'm missing you again oh no
         C
Once again
 
 
[Bridge]
 
Am     G     F               C
Some search, never finding a way
Am      G  F             C
Before long, they waste away
Am      G  F                       C
I found you, something told me to stay
Am   G F               C
I gave in, to selfish ways
Dm                         G
And how I miss someone to hold
 
when hope begins to fade...
 
C         G             Am                 Em
A lonely road, crossed another cold state line
F               C            G
Miles away from those I love purpose hard to find
 
 
[Chorus]
 
C     G      Am            G
Dear God the only thing I ask of you is
    F                C
to hold her when I'm not around,
         G
when I'm much too far away
C      G        Am             G
We all need the person who can be true to you
    F             C
I left her when I found her

And now I wish I'd stayed

’Cause I'm lonely and I'm tired

I'm missing you again oh no

Once again

G D C G D
                           G                     D
You know I like my chicken fried, cold beer on a friday night
                     C                            G      D
A pair of jeans that fit just right and the radio up

Well I was raised up beneath the shade of a georgia pine and that's home 
you know
G                 D                 C              D
Sweet tea, pecan pie and home made wine where the peaches grow
G                      D            C              D
And my house it's not much to talk about
         G                         D                C        D

I like to seen the sun rise, see the love in my woman's eyes

All the things we love

D             A              E
   There is a house built out of stone
D             A                E
   Wooden floors, walls and window sills...
D                 A             E

There is a tree as old as me
D               A          E
Branches were sewn by the color of green
Bm           Dadd9          A            E
Ground had arose and passed it's knees
       D             A          E
By the cracks of the skin I climbed to the top
Bm             Dadd9       A      E
I climbed the tree to see the world

When the gusts came around to blow me down

I held on as tightly as you held onto me

Thirteen month old baby, broke the lookin' glass.
Seven years of bad luck; the good things in your past.

You don't wanna save me, sad is my song.

Keep you in the dark

You know they all pretend

Keep you in the dark

[Verse 1]
Am
  Send in your skeletons
                                 D/F#    F
Sing as their bones go marching in... again
Am
  The need you buried deep

The secrets that you keep are at the ready
F              G
Are you ready?
Am
  I'm finished making sense
 
Done pleading ignorance
      D/F#   F     G
That old, defense
Am
  Spinning infinity, but
 
The wheel is spinning me
     D/F#         F          G
It's neverending, neverending
D
Same old story
 
 
[Chorus]
Am
What if I say I'm not like the others?
                                   D/F#
What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays?
 
You're the pretender

What if I say that I'll never surrender?
 
Am
What if I say I'm not like the others?

Am
  In time or so I'm told
                           D/F#         F   G
I'm just another soul for sale... oh, well
Am
  The page is out of print
 
We are not permanent
      D/F#       F         G
We're temporary, temporary
D
Same old story
 
 
[Chorus]
Am
What if I say I'm not like the others?

Well, you done done me and you bet I felt it
  D
I tried to be chill but you're so hot that I melted
  Em
I fell right through the cracks,
        C
Now I'm tryin' to get back
           G
Before the cool done run out I'll be givin' it my bestest
    D
And nothin's gonna stop me but divine intervention
  Em
I reckon it's again my turn
   C
To win some or learn some
 
[Chorus]

But I won't hesitate

 Well, open up your mind and see like me

Open up your plans and damn you're free
 
Look into your heart and you'll find
C
Love love love love
G                                                 D
Listen to the music of the moment people dance and sing
                        Em
We're just one big family
                                     C                       A7

[Verse]
                   G
I've been spendin' way too long checkin' my tongue in the mirror
    D
and bendin' over backwards just to try to see it clearer
    Em
But my breath fogged up the glass
         C
And so I drew a new face and I laughed
  G
I guess what I'd be sayin' is there ain't no better reason
   D
To rid yourself of vanities and just go with the seasons
Em
It's what we aim to do
    C
Our name is our virtue
 
[Chorus]

Open up your plans and damn you're free

I look into your heart and you will find that the sky is yours
   G
So please don't, please don't, please don't,
           D
There's no need to complicate,
           Em
Cause our time is short
                        C
This, this, this is our fate,

[Verse 1]
 
       G           D/F#             Em
Who am I? That the Lord of all the earth,
       D               C          D/C              C
Would care to know my name, would care to feel my hurt,

Who am I? That the bright and morning star,
       D                  C          D/C             C
Would choose to light the way, of my ever wondering heart,
G/B       C              D         C/E                    D/F#
    Not because of who I am, but because of what You've done,

Not because of what I've done, but because of who You are

I am a flower quickly fading, here today and gone tomorrow
D                      C                    G
A wave tossed in the ocean, a vapor in the wind

Would look on me with love, and watch me rise again

Am      C  F
I wanna be alone
Am                   C         F
Alone with you, does that make sense?
Am      C          F
I wanna steal your soul

And hide you in my treasure chest
 
[Verse 2]
Am           C       F
I don't know what to do
   Am                C     F
To do with your kiss on my neck
Am           C          F
I don't know what feels true

Gold on your fingertips

Fingertips against my cheek

The shirt that you let me wear home

 I hear the clock, it's six a.m.

 I feel so far from where I've been

Consoled a cup of coffee but it didn't wanna talk so I

 Picked up a paper, it was more bad news

More hearts being broken or people being used

 Put on my coat in the pouring rain

And then I take a deep breath, a good look around

 Put on my pj's and hop into bed

I'm half alive but I feel mostly dead

I can't let you go now that I got it
    Em    C       G     D                       G       Am   Em
And all I need is to be struck by your electric love
                   G
Baby your electric love
 
Am       Em
Baby, you're electric

[Verse 1]
 
            C
All this talk of getting old

It's getting me down my love

As you lay down on your side
                        Em
Now the drugs don't work

This is performed by actress Amanda Seyfried (yes the dumb girl from mean girls) in the
""Dear John"". I learned it for my girlfriend so I figured I'd put the chords down. It's a
simple song
 
Capo 2 - all chords realative
 
 
[Intro]
 
Em C
Em C
 
 
[Verse]
 
G           Em
I love this place
         C       D
But it's haunted without you
G        Em
My tired heart
           C  D
Is beating so slow
G               Em
Our hearts sing less
        C
Than we wanted
   D
We wanted
G               Em
Our hearts sing 'cause
          C
We do not know
          D
we do not know
 
 
[Chorus]
 
C            D
To light the night
           G
To help us grow
           Em
To help us grow
C         D
It is not said
G
I always know

You can catch me
          C
Don't you run
          D
Don't you run
G                Em
If you live another day
        C            D
In this happy little house
                      G
The fire's here to stay
 
 
[Chorus]
 
C            D
To light the night

To help us grow

[Bridge]
 
Em           C
Please don't make a fuss
G              D
It won't go away
Em         C
The wonder of it all
    G             D
The wonder that I made

I am here to stay

Are you lonesome tonight, do you miss me tonight?

Are you sorry we drifted apart?
           G      G            G7            G7
Does your memory stray to a brighter summer day
         G7             G7            C     C
When I kissed you and called you sweetheart?

Do the chairs in your parlor seem empty and bare?
       D            D            Dm           G
Do you gaze at your doorstep and picture me there?

Is your heart filled with pain, shall I come back again?

Tell me dear, are you lonesome tonight.
 
 
[Verse 2] (Talking verses)
 
C        Em            Am
I wonder if   you are lonesome tonight
          Am                              C
You know someone said that the world's a stage
 
And each must play a part.
C7         F                                  F
Fate had me playing ""in love"" with you as my sweetheart.
                         G
Act one was where we met, I loved you at first glance.
              G7                                   G7
You read your line so cleverly and never missed a cue.
                  G7             G7                     C
Then came act two, you seemed to change, you acted strange
 
And why, I've never known.
C7            C7                            F
   Honey, you lied when you said you loved me
          F
And I had no cause to doubt you.
D7
   But I'd rather go on hearing your lies
Dm                   G
Than to go on living without you.
C               Em                      D
Now the stage is bare and I'm standing there
D                           Dm
With emptiness all around.
                      G7
And if you won't come back to me
C                                    G7
Then they can bring the curtain down.
 
(sing again)
        C                 Em            D          D
Is your heart filled with pain, shall I come back again?
        Dm            G7                C
Tell me dear, are you lonesome tonight.

Bm                 A              D                       G
  Standing on your Mamma's porch - you told me that you'd wait forever
Bm             A            D                    G
  And when you held my hand - I knew that it was now or never
Bm               A               D*   A*                       D*  A*
  Those were the best days of my life - back in the summer of '69
 
 
[Interlude]
F             Bb
  Man we were killin' time
          C                       Bb
  We were young and reckless - we needed to unwind
F         Bb                  C
  I guess nothing can last forever...
 
 
[Instrumental]
D* A* D* A*
 
 
[Verse]
D*
  And now the times are changin'
A*
  Look at everything that's come and gone
D*
  Sometimes when I play my old six string
A*
  I think about you wonder what went wrong
 
 
[Chorus]
Bm                 A              D                 G

I am an old woman named after my mother.

My old man is another child that's grown old.
               C             G              C
If dreams were lightning and thunder were desire

this old house would've burnt down a long time ago.

As I was going over the far fam'd Kerry Mountains,

I met with Captain Farrel, and his money he was countin',

I counted out his money and it made a pretty penny,

I put it in my pocket, and I took it home to Jenny,

She sighed, and she swore that she never would deceive me,

I went into my chamber all for to take a slumber,

I dreamt of gold and jewels and for sure it was no wonder,

But Jenny drew my charges and she filled them out with water,

Then sent for Captain Farrel, to be ready for the slaughter.

Up comes a band of footmen and likewise, Captain Farrel,

I first produced my pistol for she stole away my rapier,

Mga gawi kong parang hindi pambabae e kasi

Imbes na Chinese garter laruan ko ay teks at jolens
 Am                                 D
Tapos ka-jamming ko lagi noon mga sigang lalaki sa amin

Curious na babae na ang hanap din ay babae
 C                        G
Sa halip na makeup kit bitbit ko ay gitara
 Am
Tapos pormahan ko lagi ay long sleeves na
 D
tshirt at faded na lonta
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
 Em                         Bm
Pero noong nakilala kita nagbagong bigla
                   C
ang aking timpla natuto ako na magparebond 
       D                  Em7
at mag-ahit ng kilay at least once a month
 
 Em
Hindi ko alam kung anong meron ka na sa

Isang halik mo lamang at ako ay tinatablan

At ang aking pagkababae ay nabubuhayan

Na para bang bulaklak na namumukadkad

Nung tayo’y nag-college ay saka ko lamang

Sampung buwan mong trinabaho

Nabihag mo ko sa mga tula at sa mga kanta mong pabebe

 F#m                          C#m
Kaya nga noong makilala kita alam mo na agad na 
 
mayroong himala
 D
Natuto akong magtakong at napadalas ang
 D
pagsuot ng bestidang pula
 
    F#m                    C#m
Pero di mo naman inasam na ako ay
 
magbabagong tuluyan para patunayang

Walang matigas na tinapay sa mainit na
                  E
kape ng iyong pagmamahal

[Verse 1]
 
    C9       G
It took one look
      Am                  F
And forever laid out in front of me

Only to be revived by you

My one and only one and only you...ooh...
 
 
[Verse 3]
 
         C9
Now i know 
           G                     Am
That i know not a thing at all
 F                                 C9
Except the fact that i am yours
           G             Am   F - Fsus
And that you are mine
 
 
[Verse 4]
 
         C9
Ooh

They told me that it wouldn't be easy
 F                                 C9
And i know

G                    D/F#
    It’s late in the evening
C                         D
    She’s wondering what clothes to wear
G                   D/F#
    She puts on her make up
C                       D
    And brushes her long blonde hair
C                D
    And then she asks me
G        D/F#      Em
    Do I look alright?
                C           D               G
    And I say yes, you look wonderful tonight
 
(Main Riff)
 
G              D/F#
    We go to a party
C                D
    And everyone turns to see
G                 D/F#
    This beautiful lady
C                    D
    Is walking around with me
C                 D
    And then she asks me
G           D/F#    Em
    Do you feel alright?
              C             D           G
    And I say yes, I feel wonderful tonight
 
 
D          C
    I feel wonderful
       D              G         D/F#      Em
    Because I see the love light in your eyes
            C            D
    And the wonder of it all
                C            D
    Is that you just don’t realize
               G
    How much I love you
 
(Main Riff)
 
G                       D/F#
    It’s time to go home now
C                          D
    And I’ve got an aching head
G                        D/F#
    So I give her the car keys
C                        D
    And she helps me to bed
C                  D
    And then I tell her
G          D/F#       Em
    As I turn out the light
              C                 D              G
    I say my darling, you were wonderful tonight
Em         C                D               G
    Oh my darling, you were wonderful tonight

[Verse 1]
      G
I was born by the river, in a little tent,
       Am7                                       Em
Oh and, just like that river, I've, been running, ever since.
            G         Am7                     C7          B7
It's been a long... a long time coming, but I know, oh-oh-oh,
Em                           G
 A change is gonna come, oh, yes it will.
 
[Verse 2]
          G
It's been too hard living, but I'm afraid to die,
Am7                                 Em
 'Cos I don't know what's out there, beyond the sky.
            G         Am7                     C7          B7

[Verse 3]
  G
I go to the movie and I go downtown,
Am7                              Em
 Somebody keep telling me; don't, hang around.
            G         Am7                     C7          B7
It's been a long... a long time coming, but I know, oh-oh-oh,

 A change is gonna come, oh, yes it will.
 
[Bridge]
Am7              G6
 Then I go to my brother,
Am7                          Em
 And I say; brother, help me please.
Am7              Em
 But he winds up, knockin' me,
A9               D7
 Back down on my knees, oh...
 
[Verse 4]
           G
There been times when I thought, I couldn't last for long,
Am7                          Em
 But now I think I'm able to, carry on.
            G         Am7                     C7          B7
It's been a long... a long time coming, but I know, oh-oh-oh,
Em                           G
 A change is gonna come, oh, yes it will.

Take your makeup off
 
Let your hair down, take a breath

Look into the mirror, at yourself

E                                                      Amaj7
Grew up in a town that is famous as the place of movie scenes
E                                                                     Amaj7
Noise is always loud, there are sirens all around and the streets are mean
E                                                                Amaj7
If I can make it here, I can make it anywhere, that's what they say
E                                                                 Amaj7
Seeing my face in lights or my name in marquees found down on Broadway
 
 
[Pre-chorus]
 
G#
Even if it ain’t all it seems, I got a pocketful of dreams
 
 
[Chorus]

Baby, I'm from New York
                                      E
Concrete jungle where dreams are made of
                    B
There's nothing you can't do
               Amaj7
Now you're in New York
                                  E
These streets will make you feel brand new

E                                                      Amaj7

E                                                                     Amaj7
Such a melting pot, on the corner selling rock, preachers pray to God
E                                                                Amaj7
Hail a gypsy cab, takes me down from Harlem to the Brooklyn Bridge
E                                                                 Amaj7

One hand in the air for the big city,

Street lights, big dreams all looking pretty

No place in the world that can compare

[Intro]
| G   | Em  | C   | Am C D
 
[Verse 1]
   G                        Em
Share my life, take me for what I am
         C                               Am      C D
Because I'll never change all my colors for you
 G                        Em
Take my love, I'll never ask for too much
      C                                    Am    C D
Just all that you are and everything that you do
 
[Pre-Chorus]
Am                           Bm        Em
I don't really need to look very much further
Am                         Bm              Em
I don't wanna have to go where you don't follow
Am                                Bm        Em
I won't hold it back again, this passion inside
      C                         Bm         D
Can't run from myself, there's nowhere to hide
 
[Chorus]
                   Eb             Cm
But don't make me close one more door
              Dm      Gm
I don't wanna hurt anymore
F           Eb          Cm
Stay in my arms if you dare
             Dm          Gm
Or must I imagine you there
Bb          Cm       Dm
Don't walk away from me
        Eb       Dm       F  Gm
I have nothing, nothing, nothing
       F         Bb  Gm    F    Eb   D7
If I don't have you, you, you, you, you
 
[Verse 2]
 G                             Em
You see through, right to the heart of me
      C                                       Am        C D
You break down my walls with the strength of your love
G                             Em
I never knew love like I've known it with you
         C                        Am        C D
Will a memory survive, one I can hold on to

To make a citizen out of you

Maybe they'll leave you alone
        E5
But not me
 
 
[Verse 2]
              E5
The boys and girls in the clique
 
The awful names that they stick
                                B5
You're never gonna fit in much, kid
               A5
But if you're troubled and hurt
             E5
what you got under your shirt
                 B5                          E5
will make them pay for the things that they did
 
 
[Chorus]
              E5
They said all teenagers scare the living shit out of me
E5                              B5
They could care less as long as someone'll bleed
   A5
So darken your clothes
            E5
Or strike a violent pose
              B5
Maybe they'll leave you alone
        E5
But not me
 
* oh yeah *
 
 
[Solo]
A5   E5   A5   B5
 
[Chorus]
              E5   N.C.
They said all teenagers scare the living shit out of me
 
They could care less as long as someone'll bleed
N.C.
So darken your clothes
 
Or strike a violent pose
N.C.
Maybe they'll leave you alone
 
But not me
N.C
All together now,
E5
Teenagers scare the living shit out of me
E5                              B5
They could care less as long as someone'll bleed
   A5
So darken your clothes
            E5
Or strike a violent pose
              B5
Maybe they'll leave you alone

But not me, waaaaah!
 
E5

While I'm on Sunset, are you on the subway?

D                                                      G
Long were the nights when my days once revolved around you
D                                                G
Counting my footsteps praying the floor won't fall through again

And my mother accused me of losing my mind

But I swore I was fine
 
D                                                G
You paint me a blue sky and go back and turn it to rain
        D
And I lived in your chess game
                            G
But you changed the rules everyday
A                           D           A          G
Wondering which version of you I might get on the phone

Don't you think I was too young to be messed with

And I'll look back and regret how I ignored when they said

Run as fast as you can

Dear John, I see it all now it was wrong
                          Bm
Don't you think 19's too young to be played by
      A                         G

Never impressed by me acing your tests
        Bm
All the girls that you've run dry
      A
Have tired, lifeless eyes
           G
Cause you burned them out
       A                    D         A
But I took your matches before fire could catch me
    G
So don't look now

I'm shining like fireworks

[Intro]
C  G  Am  F
 
[Verse 1]
     C
Well you done done me, and you bet I felt it
    G
I tried to be chill, but you're so hot that I melted
   Am
I fell right through the cracks
             F
And now I'm trying to get back
            C
Before the cool done run out I'll be givin' it my bestest
     G
And nothing's gonna stop me but divine intervention
   Am
I reckon it's again my turn
    F
To win some or learn some
 
[Chorus]
    C            G
But I won't hesitate
              Am
No more, no more
            F
It cannot wait
       C
I'm yours
 
[Instrumental]
(C)  G  Am  F
 
[Verse 2]
C                                      G
  Well open up your mind and see like me
                                     Am
Open up your plans and damn you're free
 
Look into your heart and you'll find
F
Love, love, love, love
C                                                 G
Listen to the music of the moment people dance and sing
                     Am
We're just one big family
 
And it's our godforsaken right to be
F
Loved, loved, loved, loved
D7
Loved
 
[Chorus]
C               G
So I won't hesitate
             Am
No more, no more
           F
It cannot wait
 
I'm sure
 
        C               G
There's no need to complicate our time
    Am
Is short
             F
This is our fate
 
I'm yours
 
[Interlude]
С             G
D-d-do do you, but do you, d-d-do
Am                   G
But do you want to come on
                F
Scooch on over closer dear
                        D
And I will nibble your ear
 
[Instrumental]
C  G  Am  G  F  D7
 
[Verse 3]
                C
I've been spending way too long
 
Checking my tongue in the mirror
    G
And bending over backwards just to try to see it clearer
    Am
But my breath fogged up the glass
          F
And so I drew a new face and I laughed
   C
I guess what I be saying is there ain't no better reason
    G
To rid yourself of vanity and just go with the seasons
     Am
It's what we aim to do
     F
Our name is our virtue
 
[Chorus]
    C            G
But I won't hesitate
             Am
No more, no more,
           F
It cannot wait
 
I'm yours
 
[Outro]
C                               G
Open up your mind and see like me
                                     Am
Open up your plans and damn you're free
 
Look into your heart and you'll find
F
The sky is yours
C
So please don't please don't please don't
 
           G
There's no need to complicate
          Am
Cause our time is short
                              F
This, oh this, oh this is our fate
          D7
I'm yours
 
N.C.                    C     G   Am  F
Ah, ba ba dum ba ba dum eyyy...

[Verse]
 
C
I remember what you wore on the first day
Am
You came into my life and I thought
F                    G                    C
""Hey, you know, this could be something""
C
'Cause everything you do and words you say
Am
You know that it all takes my breath away
F           G                 C
And now I'm left with nothing
 
 
[Chorus]
 
                  F
'Cause maybe it's true
             G
That I can't live without you
      F                  G
Maybe two is better than one
                F
There's so much time
   G
To figure out the rest of my life
        Am                  G          F
And you thought that it got me coming undone
                 Am     G           C
And I'm thinking two is better than one
 
 
[Verse]
 
C
I remember every look upon your face
Am
The way you roll your eyes
            F
The way you taste
            G                  C
You make it hard for breathing
C
'Cause when I close my eyes and drift away
Am
I think of you and everything's okay
F           G             C
I'm finally now believing
 
 
[Chorus]
 
                 F
That maybe it's true
              G
That I can't live without you
      F                  G
Maybe two is better than one
                F
There's so much time
   G
To figure out the rest of my life
        Am                  G          F
And you thought that it got me coming undone
                 Am     G           F     G

There's so much time
   G
To figure out the rest of my life
         Am
But I'll figure it out
          G            F
When it's all said and done
Am     G           C
Two is better than one
Am     G           C
Two is better than one

[Verse]
 
               Am
It starts with one thing I don't know why
   G
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
F
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme
   G
To explain in due time
 
         Am
All I know, time is a valuable thing
G
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
F
Watch it count down to the end of the day
         G
The clock ticks life away
 
          Am
It's so unreal, didn't look out below
G
Watch the time go right out the window
F
Trying to hold on, but didn't even know
   G
Or wasted it all just to 
 
          Am
Watch you go, I kept everything inside
    G
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
F
What it meant to me will eventually be
   G
A memory of a time when
 
 
[Chorus]
 
           Am              C
I tried so hard and got so far
           G                   F
But in the end it doesn't even matter
         Am              C
I had to fall to lose it all
           G                   F
But in the end it doesn't even matter
 
 
[Verse]
 
Am
One thing, I don't know why
   G
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
F
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme
   G
To remind myself how
 
           Am                                         G
I tried so hard, in spite of the way you were mocking me
                                     F
Acting like I was part of your property
                                          G
Remembering all the times you fought with me
 
                        Am
I'm surprised it got so far
                                     G
Things aren't the way they were before
                                     F
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
                                   G
Not that you knew me back then but it all comes back to me 
 
       Am
In the end you kept everything inside
         G
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
F
What it meant to me will eventually be
       G
A memory of a time when
 
 
[Chorus]
 
           Am              C
I tried so hard and got so far
           G                   F
But in the end it doesn't even matter
         Am              C
I had to fall to lose it all 
           G                   F
But in the end it doesn't even matter
 
 
[Bridge]
 
            Am       G
I've put my trust in you
          F           G
Pushed as far as I can go
             Am
And for all this 
             G                    F   G
There's only one thing you should know
 
            Am       C
I've put my trust in you
          G            F
Pushed as far as I can go
             Am
And for all this
             C                    G   F
There's only one thing you should know
 
 
[Chorus]
 
           Am              C
I tried so hard and got so far
           G                   F
But in the end it doesn't even matter
         Am              C
I had to fall to lose it all
           G                   F
But in the end it doesn't even matter

Who am I? That the eyes that see my sin,

Would call out through the rain, and calm the storm in me,

               C                   D7                                  G
Weathered faces lined in pain, are soothed beneath the artist's loving hand
 
[Chorus]
              Am     D7                   G        Em
And now I understand    what you tried to say to me
                         Am7     D7                           Em
How you suffered for your sanity     How you tried to set them free
                                A7          Am7   D7           G
They would not listen, they did not know how   perhaps they listen now
 
[Extended Chorus]
G                 Am7      D7                        G     Em
For they could not love you,  but still your love was true
            Am7                            Cm6
And when no hope was left in sight on that starry, starry night
    G                F7           E7         Am7
You took your life as lovers often do,  But I could have told you Vincent
     C                                D7           G
This world was never meant for one as beautiful as you
 
[Verse 3]
               G
Starry, starry night
                  Am
Portraits hung in empty halls
                   C                     D7                                  G
Frameless heads on nameless walls, with eyes that watch the world and can't forget
                                                     Am
Like the strangers that you've met, the ragged men in ragged clothes
                      C                D7                               G
The silver thorn, the bloody rose, lie crushed and broken on the virgin snow
 
[Final Chorus]
                  Am     D7                  G          Em
And now I think I know      what you tried to say to me
                         Am7     D7                           Em
How you suffered for your sanity    How you tried to set them free
                                   A7               Am7   D7               G
They would not listen, they're not  listening still     perhaps they never will

C Am
 
 
[Verse 1]
     C                 Am
I’ve heard there was a secret chord
     C                   Am
That David played and it pleased the Lord
    F                G              C        G
But you don’t really care for music do you?
   C                   F           G
It goes like this, the fourth, the fifth
    Am              F
The minor fall, the major lift
    G                Em         Am
The baffled King composing Hallelujah
 
 
[Chorus]
     F           Am
Hallelujah, hallelujah
     F           C G C G
Hallelujah, hallelujah
 
 
[Verse 2]
      C                       Am
Your faith was strong but you needed proof
      C             Am
You saw her bathing on the roof
       F           G              C         G
Her beauty in the moonlight overthrew you
    C             F       G
She tied you to a kitchen chair
    Am                         F
She broke your throne, and she cut your hair
    G                  Em            Am
And from your lips she drew the hallelujah
 
 
[Chorus]
     F           Am
Hallelujah, hallelujah
     F           C G C G
Hallelujah, hallelujah
 
 
[Verse 3]
C               Am
Maybe I’ve been here before
  C                    Am
I know this room, I’ve walked this floor
   F             G              C      G
I used to live alone before I knew you
     C                     F      G
I’ve seen your flag on the marble arch
Am            F
Love is not a victory march
       G               Em          Am
It’s a cold and it’s a broken hallelujah
 
 
[Chorus]
     F           Am
Hallelujah, hallelujah
     F           C G C G
Hallelujah, hallelujah
 
 
[Verse 4]
      C                   Am
There was a time when you let me know
       C            Am
What’s really going on below
     F             G             C      G
But now you never show it to me, do you?
      C             F        G
And remember when I moved in you
    Am            F
The Holy Dove was moving too
    G               Em            Am
And every breath we drew was hallelujah
 
 
[Chorus]
     F           Am
Hallelujah, hallelujah
     F           C G C G
Hallelujah, hallelujah
 
 
[Verse 5]
C               Am
Maybe there’s a God above
      C         Am
And all I ever learned from love
    F                G               C       G
Was how to shoot at someone who outdrew you
         C                 F       G
And it’s not a cry you can hear at night
     Am                 F
It’s not somebody who’s seen the light
       G               Em          Am
It’s a cold and it’s a broken hallelujah
 
 
[Chorus]
     F           Am
Hallelujah, hallelujah
     F           C G
Hallelujah, hallelujah
     F           Am
Hallelujah, hallelujah
     F           C G C
Hallelujah, hallelujah

D                                                     F#7
Hate to give the satisfaction asking how you're doing now
                                                       G
How's the castle built off people you pretend to care about?
 
Just what you wanted
        Gm**
Look at you, cool guy, you got it
D                                                             F#7
 I see the parties and the diamonds sometimes when I close my eyes
                                                     G
Six months of torture you sold as some forbidden paradise
 
I loved you truly
          Gm**
You gotta laugh at the stupidity
 
 
[Chorus]
                      Em
'Cause I've made some real big mistakes
                 A7
But you make the worst one look fine
            D
I should've known it was strange
         F#7
You only come out at night
          G
I used to think I was smart
                Gm
But you made me look so naïve
            D
The way you sold me for parts
                 F#7
As you sunk your teeth into me, oh
G*           Gm*
Bloodsucker, famefucker
N.C.                                  D
Bleeding me dry like a goddamn vampire

You called them crazy, God, I hate the way I called them crazy too
 
You're so convincing
           Gm
How do you lie without flinching 
 
(How do you lie? How do you lie? How do you lie?)
D                                                    F#7
Oh, what a mesmerizing, paralyzing, fucked up little thrill
                                                          G
Can't figure out just how you do it and God knows I never will
 
Went for me and not her

'Cause girls your age know better

I've made some real big mistakes

 You said it was true love
Gm
   But wouldn't that be hard
D
 You can't love anyone
       A
'Cause that would mean you had a heart
G                       Gm
 I tried to help you out, now I know that I can't

INTRO:
NONE
 
VERSE:
 F                Am
She just wants to be 
               F
Beautiful she goes 
                 Am
Unnoticed, she knows 
    G           F
No limits she craves 
                 Am
Attention, she praises 
 
An image
      F
She prays to be 
                  F
Sculpted by the sculptor
 
 
VERSE:
               F
Oh, she don't see 
                  Am
The light that's shining
                          F
Deeper than the eyes can find it
                        Am
Maybe we have made her blind
         G                    F
So she tries to cover up her pain 
                  Am
And cut her woes away
                         F
'Cause covergirls don't cry 
 
After their face is made
 
 
 
CHORUS:
               F
But there's a hope 
                               Am
That's waiting for you in the dark
                         F
You should know you're beautiful 
                 Am
Just the way you are

And you don't have to change a thing
                            Am
The world could change its heart
                   F
No scars to your beautiful, 
                        F
We're stars and we're beautiful

VERSE:
                  Am
She has dreams to be 
             F
An envy, so she's 
 
Starving you know,
 Am             G           F
covergirls eat nothing she says 
                                      Am
""Beauty is pain and there's beauty in everything""
                         F
""What's a little bit of hunger?""
 
""I could go a little while longer,""
 F
She fades away
G          F
She don't see her perfect, 
          Am
She don't understand she's worth it
         F
Or that beauty goes deeper than the surface
   Am
Oh Oh
   G
Oh oh
       F
So to all the girls that's hurting
       Am
Let me be your mirror, 
                F
Help you see a little bit clearer
 
The light that shines within

We're stars and we're beautiful

No better you than the you that you are
No better you than the you that you are
 
No better life than the life we're living
No better life than the life we're living
 
No better time for your shine, you're a star
No better time for your shine, you're a star
 
Oh, you're beautiful, oh, you're beautiful

If all our life is but a dream

[Verse]
G
I was Cleopatra, I was young and an actress
                                                D
When you knelt by my mattress, and asked for my hand
          G
But I was sad you asked it, as I laid in a black dress
                                     D
With my father in a casket, I had no plans
 
[Break]
G
 
[Pre-chorus]
G                                  C              G
And I left the footprints, the mud stained on the carpet
                                                D
And it hardened like my heart did when you left town
      G                           C                G
But I must admit it, that I would marry you in an instant
                                                      D
Damn your wife, I'd be your mistress just to have you around
 
[Chorus]
          G        D     C        G     C            G          D
But I was late for this, late for that, late for the love of my life
           G   D             C   G             C        G     D
And when I die alone, when I die alone, when I die I'll be on time
 
[Break]
G
 
[Pre-chorus II]
          G                       C                       G
While the church discouraged, any lust that burned within me
                                             D
Yes my flesh, it was my currency, but I held true
     G                     C         G
So I drive a taxi, and the traffic distracts me
         C               G                        D
From the strangers in my backseat, they remind me of you
 
[Chorus]
          G        D     C        G     C            G          D
But I was late for this, late for that, late for the love of my life

[Bridge]
        Em                 G           C     D     Em
And the only gifts from my Lord were a birth and a divorce

[Pre-chorus II]
      G                C               G
I was Cleopatra, I was taller than the rafters
                                              D
But that's all in the past now, gone with the wind
      G                    C                   G
Now a nurse in white shoes leads me back to my guestroom
       C         G
It's a bed and a bathroom
                    D
And a place for the end
 
[Chorus]
            G       D     C        G     C            G          D
I won't be late for this, late for that, late for the love of my life
           G   D             C   G             C        G     D
And when I die alone, when I die alone, when I die I'll be on time

[Verse 1]
             A                                 E
All of these lines across my face tell you the story of who I am
        F#m                                  D
So many stories of where I've been and how I got to where I am
          A                  E                     F#m           D

     A     E              A  Asus4 A
It's true, I was made for you
 
[Verse 2]
           A                                  E
I climbed across the mountain tops, swam all across the ocean blue

I crossed all the lines and I broke all the rules
            D
But baby, I broke them all for you

Oh, because even when I was flat broke

[Verse 3]
(A)
You see the smile that's on my mouth
                E
It's hiding the words that don't come out
           F#m
All of our friends who think that I'm blessed
           D
They don't know my head's a mess

No, they don't know who I really am

And they don't know what I've been through like you do

G note by playing the 3rd fret of the E string (X-3-2-0-1-3), or as Cadd9's (X-3-2-0-3-3). You can also mix
it up and play C through the verse, C* in the chorus (You can also try keeping 3rd fret on the E string pinned
on all the chords throughout the chorus) and Cadd9 in the bridge. Have fun with it, it's a fun song to play
anyway.....about a seriously hard life but still a fun song, musically, to play around with.
 
Capo 2
 
[Intro]
 
G    D/F# Em    C G
 
 
[Verse 1]
 
G
White lips, pale face,
             D/F#     Em
Breathing in snowflakes,
            C     G
Burnt lungs, sour taste.
G
Light's gone, day's end,
              D/F#    Em
Struggling to pay rent,
             C       G
Long nights, strange men.
 
 
[Chorus]
 
Am7                             C
And they say she's in the Class A Team,
             G
Stuck in her daydream,
                    D/F#               Am7
Been this way since 18, but lately her face seems
                C
Slowly sinking, wasting,
               G
Crumbling like pastries,
 
And they scream,
    D/F#
The worst things in life come free to us,
          Em             C
Cos we're just under the upperhand,
G
And go mad for a couple grams,
Em                    C       G
And she don't want to go outside tonight,
         Em                    C
And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland,
G
Or sells love to another man,
Em         C         G
It's too cold outside,
    D/F#      Em  C  G
For angels to fly,
          Em  C  G
Angels to fly,
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
G
Ripped gloves, raincoat,
                  D/F#      Em
Tried to swim and stay afloat,
           C    G
Dry house, wet clothes.
 
Loose change, bank notes,
            D/F#     Em
Weary-eyed, dry throat,
           C    G
Call girl, no phone.
 
 
[Chorus]
 
Am7                             C
And they say she's in the Class A Team,
             G
Stuck in her daydream,
                    D/F#               Am7
Been this way since 18, but lately her face seems

And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland,

It's too cold outside,
    D/F#      Am7
For angels to fly,
              C
An angel will die.
 
 
[Bridge]
 
           Em
Covered in white,
 
Closed eye,
    G
And hoping for a better life,
Am7                       C
This time, we'll fade out tonight,
                  Em   C   G   G
Straight down the line.
 
Em   C   G
 
 
[Chorus]
 
Am7                             C
And they say she's in the Class A Team,

Angels to fly,

To fly,     fly,
G         Em      C       G
Angels to fly, to fly, to fly,

Angels to die.

[Verse 1]
A
Woke up cold one tuesday,
Cadd9                 G
i'm looking tired and feeling quite sick, 
A                                             Cadd9      E
i felt like there was something missing in my day to day life, 
     A
so i quickly opened the wardrobe, 
Cadd9                       G
pulled out some jeans and a T-Shirt that seemed clean, 
A
topped it off with a pair of old shoes, 
          Cadd9             E
that were ripped around the seams,
              Dsus2
and i thought these shoes just don't suit me. 
 
[Chorus]
A               E
Hey, I put some new shoes on, 
    Dsus2
and suddenly everything is right,
        A               E
I said, hey, I put some new shoes on 
    Dsus2
and everybody's smiling, its so inviting, 
    A                   E
Oh, short on money, but long on time,
Dsus2
slowly strolling in the sweet sunshine,
    A
and i'm running late,
           E
and i dont need an excuse,
           Dsus2
'cause i'm wearing my brand new shoes.
 
[Verse 2]
A
Woke up late one thursday,
Cadd9                   G
i'm seeing stars as i'm rubbing my eyes, 
      A
and i felt like there were two days missing, 
      Cadd9          E
as i focused on the time,
      A
and i made my way to the kitchen,
Cadd9                        G
but i had to stop from the shock of what i found,
A                              Cadd9             E
a room full of all my friends dancing round and round,
              Dsus2
and i thought hello new shoes, byebye blues. 
 
[Chorus]
A               E
Hey, I put some new shoes on, 
    Dsus2
and suddenly everything is right,

I said, hey, I put some new shoes on

[Breakdown]

Take me wondering through these streets, 
A                                    Cadd9
where bright lights and angels meet, 
A
stone to stone they take me on,  
   Dsus2
im walking to the break of dawn.

You should've seen it in color
 
 
[Verse 2]
        G
Aw, and this one here's taken overseas
       F
In the middle of Hell in 1943
       C                                  G
In the winter time, you can almost see my breath
         G
That was my tail gunner: Ole Johnny McGee
         F
He was a High School teacher from New Orleans
       C                                     G
And he had my back, right through the day we left
 
 
[Chorus]
 
      G
If it looks like we were scared to death
       F                                       C
Like a couple of kids just tryin' to save each other
                          G
You should've seen it in color
  G
A picture's worth a thousand words
        F                                         C
But you can't see what those shades of gray keep covered

You should've seen it in color

[Verse 3]
 
G
This one is my favorite one
        F
This is me and grandma in the summer sun
 C                                 G
All dressed up the day we said our vows
          G
You can't tell it here but it was hot that June
     F
That rose was red and her eyes were blue
         C                            G
And just look at that smile, I was so proud
 
 
[Bridge]
 
Em              D/F#        C
     That's the story of my life
Em         D/F#                C  D
     Right there in black and white

A picture's worth a thousand words

But you can't see what those shades of gray keep covered

Debated on who’s wrong or right

[Verse 1]
  C         Am         Em      F
I found a guy, told me I was a star
   C           Am         Em          F
He held the door, held my hand in the dark
           Am         Em              F
And he's perfect on paper, but he's lying to my face
         Am                  Em           F
Does he think that I'm the kinda girl who needs to be saved?
 
C Am Em F
 
[Verse 2]
            C        Am        Em      F
And there's one more boy, he's from my past
   C         Am         Em      F
We fell in love, but it didn’t last
             Am        Em              F
'Cause the second I figure it out, he pushes me away
 
Am                Em            F
And I won't fight for love if you won't meet me halfway
       G                             G7
And I say that I'm through, but this song's still for you
 
[Chorus]
F       G                 Am
All I want is love that lasts
                           F
Is all I want too much to ask?
        G                  Am
Is it something wrong with me?
F       G               Am
All I want is a good guy
                              F
Are my expectations far too high?
           G                 C
Try my best, but what can I say?
        Cmaj7     Am    Am7             F
All I have is myself at the end of the day
    G                            C Cmaj7 Am Am7 F
But shouldn't that be enough for me?

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
 
[Verse 3]
      C        Am              Em          F
And I miss the days when I was young and naive
              C           Am             Em   F
I thought the perfect guy would come and find me
    G                                        A
Now happy ever after, it don't come so easily
